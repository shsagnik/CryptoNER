($3k x 12.5 BTC) is less than ($10k x 6.25 BTC) So it sounds like you don't really have a damn clue what you're talking about. But the reality is that Bitcoin's price is going to be higher next year, so this really won't be an issue at all.

ANYONE can sign up for COIL and get streaming micro payments via ILP, in fact Im surprised every news site hasnt integrated this as it takes 5 minutes and gives you money in the currency of your choice directly to your account. 2. Dont phrase it or attempt to paint it in the light that Ripple is paying him, its Anyone who is a COIL subscriber and wants to view his content. This is ILP/COIL it is a \"new\" web monetization model for content creators. If you dont like it, Dont Subscribe to COIL and dont view his content, pretty easy. 3. What is different than posting Any other website that runs Ads as opposed to someone supporting COIL? if anything you should be happy because it is someone pushing adoption and wanting to change the way the current web monetization model sucks. COIL encourages better less clickbait content. You are not required to put ads anymore on your stuff, which means the Best quality content gets the most views in this new payment model."

  "reddit": "Personally, I'm heavy into BTC and ETH. They are the big dogs that I want in my portfolio. As the first movers in their respective category, they not only have the most developers working on/with the network, but they have the most adoption so far. The chances that those two survive for years and grow into mature ecosystems are very high, in my opinion. Beyond them, I wanted coins that are targeting developer adoption. So, I have a few coins that are platforms like ETH, they are technically ETH competitors, but I don't think there is going to be \"1 platform to rule them all.\" Just like I don't think JavaScript/Node should be used everywhere, or that Python is the best, or that large enterprises would be crazy to not use Java or C#/.Net. These other blockchains don't require devs to learn a new language like Solidity though; devs can keep using C#, Python, Node, etc to build enterprise level blockchain solutions. So, I diversified where I thought developers in the next 1-3 years might go. Next I thought about what industries could really use transparency and trustless exchange of data and value. That's where I started looking into supply chain coins. So, I've got a few supply chain coins in my portfolio. Then, I thought about things that are important to me, like privacy, connecting the \"old\" systems (REST/SOAP APIs to blockchain), and faster payment transactions. So, I also have coins that are in those categories. In all, I have 12 coins that I've chosen in several different categories. I do think it's crazy if people don't have BTC and ETH as part of their overall portfolio though. If someone goes all in with $20,000 into some random coin, that is just nuts. Only diversify if there is a reason to though. If you have a substantial amount of money you are putting in, then you should probably diversify."

Chinas suspected of using their prison population as an organ supply, many of these people could be in prison for dissent against the Chinese government for speaking out against personal freedoms and suppression of information. Is facilitating black market organ trade really any worse than a government using their prison population to ramp up their organ supply? Huge Banks have been caught laundering money for drug cartels, do you see any of these CEOs in prison for facilitating drug trade? Usually they pay a fine which was probably priced into their risk assessment from the beginning, the CEOs still come out on top as winners and live rich luxurious lives. Does any of this sound fair to you? Why are government and institutions protected from these crimes but individuals pay with their life? Maybe it does seem fair to you but I’m just trying to convey how complicated the situation is compared to the depth of your assesment.

Every coin in the market is people buying in to get rich or move money out of shitty countries. People like you are impossible to argue with because you're actually completely full of shit, you're the main reason why plebs come in here and get scammed holding coins that will never regain their value, then you pretend as if the insentive for buying that coin was so that you can look at the gimmicks behind the coin and stroke your cock endlessly, while its value collapses far behind bitcoin and every other new gimmick coin that comes out during every new bubble cycle."

If I make gains on a crypto, convert them to USD That's a taxable transaction. convert them back and lose whatever gains I made initially This is called a capital loss and it gets subtracted from your taxable income when you pay taxes. I believe in the US, you can deduct up to $5k/year in this manner, with the excess losses carrying over to the next year if necessary. What are the consequences if I make a mistake and don’t pay taxes on my crypto gains correctly? It depends on whether the IRS notices or not. If they do notice, they'll send you a bill which asks for the difference in payment plus interest and a fee. I'm very new to crypto AND taxes At the core of it all, it's about how much profit you make. If you mine crypto, that's profit and gets taxed like any other income. If you trade crypto for literally anything else (ie. USD, goods/services, other crypto), that counts as a sale and is a taxable transaction in which you are taxed on profits. Profits are calculated as sale price minus the cost basis (the amount you originally paid, including any fees). Something you'll want to read about is FIFO (and/or LIFO).

But when the next big recession begins to bite and the buying power of the major fiat currencies is depreciating more rapidly then we will begin to see more adoption in retail in larger economies as businesses see their profit in fiat being eroded by inflation. This effect is at present just perceptible in smaller economies already in crisis such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe, etc. where, for example, DASH (which is faster and cheaper to use than BTC) is beginning to gain traction as a currency rather than just a commodity. In the UK where quantitative easing and Brexit are having an obvious impact on the buying power of the pound people are beginning to take more interest in the potential of cryptocurrencies when travelling abroad. But I anticipate that because of high fees and slow transactions BTC will continue to be seen mainly as a commodity or reserve currency against which those cryptocurrencies actually in daily use as micro transaction currencies can be traded."

There is some interesting logic here and I've wondered the same myself, but only constrained it to things like... video games where people are rewarded tiny amounts for every selfish in-game action, but can win a larger amount if they forgo selfish actions and win the game with their team. I'd like to say that with higher stakes (such as the security of the chain you're voting for), the individual voter wouldn't be as selfish, but humans are strange!

I’ve been studying health for years and it’s clear to me that America has amazing technology and a lot of people who are truly pushing the industry forward and are cutting edge. It’s very rare to find that outside of USA. That absolutely doesn’t mean it’s perfect. It’s clearly too expensive and people shouldn’t be completely ruined because of healthcare costs. Just that this is complicated and the reasons for it being so expensive in the USA is multifaceted. For example, did you know that if you pay in cash yourself you can often get up to 80% off the price? The reason for this is because the main cost for the hospitals is the negotiation with the insurance companies! The major cost for all health institutions is not the procedure, it’s the cost of dealing with insurance companies, hence they offer huge discounts if you pay yourself in cash. Many people are not aware of this, it’s actually often economically better to pay immediately yourself because you’ll pay less than half the price now instead of the full price later from your deductible! You know what the insurance companies tried to do when they realized people started doing this to save tons of money and not have to put thousands on their deductible? They put a clause in their contract that says if you even ASK the hospital what the cash price is compared to insurance price that you are immediately disqualified from using insurance to pay for it! So if you even try to inform yourself of a better price, you’ll lose your power to make your choice whether to pay it or to put it on your insurance. Price transparency and laws around preventing insurance companies from being able to do bullshit like that would go a long way already from the current situation."

You’ll see the coin’s pairings and the exchange. Let’s take EDU for example, the platform is Huobi and the pairings are: EDU/ETH and EDU/BTC. Meaning that the Houbi exchange platform is set up to trade EduCoin for Bitcoin or Ethereum. 3. Purchase the amount you’d like to spend on EDU in either BTC or ETH. 4. Create an account on Houbi 5. Transfer your BTC/ETH to your Houbi wallet 6. Trade your BTC/ETH for EDU on their exchange. You’ll have to either set a limit or market order. Limit order means you set the max price and amount of coins. Market means you’ll take the next available sell order price until you reach the amount of coins you want to purchase, or your balance is drained. Good luck!

The extra ballots are sent back to the county clerk in a box. The electronic votes are recorded on a microchip and sealed in an envelope. The voted paper ballots are sent back in a special box. There are two judges, a D and a R who bring back all extra ballots and voted paper, and microchips from the electronic machine and from the ballot box. I PROMISE there is NO FUCKING WAY ANYONE IS MESSING WITH THE PAPER BALLOTS. We don't just give out ballots like kleenex, EVERYTHING IS RECORDED. Someone fucked up a ballot? It literally gets signed off, put into an envelope, put into ANOTHER ENVELOPE, counted and recorded, and voter is given another ballot. The second ballot is noted on the voter's record as well. After the judges are there from 5am to 9:30 pm (or later!), WE JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF THERE. THE ONLY TIME there was EVER something odd going on IS WHEN PEOPLE VOTE ELECTRONICALLY. Not in MY precinct, but in MANY OTHERS, voters have tried to vote for D candidate and it changed vote to R. Some people had to click on their candidate 3 or 4 times before it registered the correct vote. And before you get your vote recorded, you have the option to review and change a vote. Electronic blockchain voting exclusively is the most ridiculous and dangerous way to vote. Because, no one has EVER hacked and stolen millions of bitcoin via blockchain, right? GTFOH. Maybe Yang needs to work an election before BEING in an election. TLDR: Paper ballots are better and CANNOT BE HACKED OR CHANGED.

Huge gains are just as bad as huge losses. Except that gold, the world's most renowned store of value, does not have \"absolutely superb stability\". You're talking out of your ass. The whole Venezuela thing has nothing to do with SoV. Literally the complete opposite of reality. The fact that you think the Venezuela situation has anything to do with SoV kind of invalidates your argument. You're not making an argument. Venezuelans use Bitcoin to store their value every single day. When you buy bitcoin for the purpose of saving your earned wealth for the future, to avoid losing value, this is using Bitcoin as a store of value. This is literally exactly what Venezuelans are doing. Gold is a store of value because gold has intrinsic value. It's useful for electronics, it's useful as jewelry, etc I refuse to believe that anyone is this ignorant. Jewelry? Lol.. What the fuck? Gold's price has nothing to do with fucking jewelry. Please look up the stock to flow model of pricing commodities. Bitcoin has the limited supply, but if it's not a digital currency, it's just a quaint digit collectible with a crazy unstable price. Bitcoin is used for more real world value transfer than all the altcoins combined. You don't have a clue what you're talking about. Bitcoin is the only crypto with any use as a means of exchange.

  "reddit": "Elastos is an operating system, a decentralised internet and a Virtual Machine (VM) tool all wrapped up into one. It has its own operating system to run on devices without one (e.g. IoT devices), it aims to improve security by using the blockchain as an internet protocol rather than TCP/IP and it allows DApps to run across any operating system - including phones - using what is essentially a VM (called Elastos Runtime). It works to improve security by assigning everything running on Elastos (including devices, digital assets, servers, DApps) their own ID or 'Universal Unique Identifier'. This is checked on startup by the Elastos blockchain and only following validation is an internet connection established. This aids prevent DDoS attacks. Furthermore as all DApps run on Runtime they do not touch the device, Elastos OS or any other DApp - they essentially operate in a vacuum. There are other projects which aim to do some parts of Elastos but there are none (to my knowledge) that are trying to combine it all as Elastos is attempting to do. What is it? Let’s break down the whitepaper bit by bit, beginning with the introduction and vision: Elastos aims to create a new kind of Internet, powered by blockchain technology: This is similar to many of the claims made about Ethereum and others. Elastos wants to make digital assets scarce, identifiable and tradable. Property rights pave the way for wealth creation, and Elastos intends to build a new World Wide Web that respects those rights: Whilst there are other projects sharing this goal, I’m not sure any of the other platforms have made this as high a priority as Elastos have, given this in the opening paragraph of the whitepaper. The goal is to create an Internet that allows users to access articles, movies and games directly, without going through a media player or another platform intermediary: Again, there are other projects aiming to let people do this but it is more DApps aiming to do this, not platforms. It is interesting that they aim to bypass other media players entirely here. Elastos will be a platform for decentralized applications (Dapps) that runs on a peer-to-peer network with no centralized control: Nothing particularly new here. People can access these Dapps via their mobile phones, without changing their operating system: This is interesting and the first part of the project which really stands out. One of the main issues with a lot of DApps is the inability to run them on mobile phones at present. Elastos wants to create a new World Wide Web that is safer and smarter, and that can one day be known as the Internet of Wealth: Continuing the confused marketing theme, burying the vision (actually located at the end of the whitepaper) is an odd move and it is unclear what a smarter WWW might actually resemble. Source: You can build a dApp on Ethereum or NEO or you can build the exact same dApp on the Ethereum/NEO sidechain of Elastos and have access to all of the above features. Elastos is creating an intranet to replace the current www. standard we use today. It's really neat stuff if you can wrap your head around it."

For all we know there could be 10 times as many monero coins as we thing there are .... if such bug has already happened. So all thought monero offers excellent privacy it does not offer enough transparency. I rather have a balance between the two and so I am sticking with Bitcoin Cash.

Why put your savings in a bank earning 0.01% interest a year? put that shit to work on compound and earn +10% a year. The DAO was quickly coded, and not properly audited. So somebody found 1 out of at least 5 ways to drain the DAO. As a result, the idea was to roll back the chain prior to hack and disburse the ETH. I believe at the time it was roughly 13-15% of all ETH was locked up in the DAO so it became a big deal. I was against it, and became a big ETC fan. However, ETC after being forked just laid around doing nothing and even stopped using updates from ethereum. As such, ETC gained very few developers but a large following of 'purists'. However these purists did nothing to contribute other than buying ETC. Thats not really a community. Fast forward to now and ETH is king of smart contracts with the most developers."

  "reddit": "I think it's a legit question, but I take issue with some of your assumptions. The main thing to consider is whether the factors that triggered the 2008 financial crisis and global recession are still in play. The mere existence of debt was not one of those factors--otherwise the 2008 financial crisis would have happened decades earlier. Rather, it was the existence of specific types of high-risk debt, and financial instruments tied to those high-risk debts--e.g., securities in which high-risk loans were packaged together and rated at low risk, and credit default swaps (insurance policies on those securities). Credit default swaps in particular got so out-of-control that investment firms were allowing people with no connection to the underlying security/debt to buy them. That's like allowing a stranger to take out an insurance policy that pays when your house catches fire. If financial instruments like those are allowed to proliferate again (and some argue that they are proliferating right now), then that could cause another financial crisis. Appropriate financial regulations could stop these abuses, however. Next, the overall amount of global debt doesn't really matter as long as it remains more-of-less the same when measured as a percentage of global GDP. For example, the U.S. national debt grew exponentially during the 20th century, but so did the U.S. GDP--meaning that the United States' ability to pay its national debt grew at roughly the same rate as its national debt. The result was that by the year 2000, the U.S. enjoyed some of the most favorable interest rates in the world on its government bonds. So, if global GDP continues to increase at roughly the same rate as global debt, then the debt itself will not be a problem for the global economy. Keep in mind that the purpose of debt is to add liquidity to the economy, to keep money flowing. Eliminating all debt would actually be counter-productive because it would slow economic growth to a crawl. TL;DR: The existence of debt didn't cause the 2008 financial crisis; unregulated, high-risk financial instruments did that. The existence of debt is necessary for economic growth. The overall amount of debt doesn't matter as long as you have the income sufficient to pay it. This is true at both a personal and a global level."

This project seems to be based on 0xBitcoin and BOMB, but the community is solid and people are spending real money mining a token that has no real value at the moment. It's nice to see, it feels grass roots and passes the smell test. There is no owner, its all community based, and we have mining pools, stats pages, new website, bots, and more resources all run by various people who found the project and wanted to help. This project doesn't have a huge \"Wow!\" factor, but it has a solid foundation and I am taking a bet on it working out.

However, I think that Hillary Clinton uses it just as much, if not more, than Trump. And the media is the worst, as they use it to condition people and pump up their viewing numbers. Now, how do these tactics correspond with reality? When Trump talks about the migration problems, is that really \"racist?\" Mass movements of people virtually ALWAYS lead to conflict at best, war at worst. The movement of illegal immigrants into the U.S. has been the biggest recorded movement of peoples in history. So, IMO, Trump's anti-illegal immigration fear persuasion at least corresponds with reality observed through history and fact. There will be conflict in the U.S., whether you like it or not... but things will be a lot better if there aren't 10s of millions of more people here who hate the very country they invaded. HRC basically claimed Trump is a Nazi. Have any Jews been rounded up yet? Trump is very pro-Israel, and IMO that is a negative thing. She (and the media) claim him to be racist, yet there are plenty of black and hispanic people who have worked for Trump that claim otherwise. Thus, in this example, I think it is fairly obvious that Trumps \"fear-based fact-free action\", whatever that means, at least corresponds with reality more than Hillary's \"Trump is literally Hitler on steroids\" rhetoric."

You still haven't shown any proof that happened, and I'm certain that if it did, it wasn't sanctioned by anyone from the IOTA team. Fringe parts of every communities do stupid shit, and they get shut down every time. That is not negotiable no matter how much you want to witch hunt us and incite doxxing and bounties on our heads No matter how I want to witch hunt you? Are you fucking serious? I made the initial /r/IOTA post about you guys being assholes and greylisting IOTA, by the way, which lead to Sergey Ivancheglo's moronic tweet. Now, if you read my comments following the fiasco, you'd realize that I very much condemned his words. Putting a bounty on someone's info is completely unacceptable, but once again, that has nothing to do with IOTA and all to do with CfB. If he had been a Walmart employee, would you have blacklisted Walmart? Doesn't make any fucking sense. You are not on the right side of the fence on this issue."

  "reddit": "Here are all of the misguided maximalists' talking points that are likely to pop up: \"It's still way less what we use for gold!\" -- Never followed up by hard data (therefore impossible to prove or disprove), nor even relevant considering gold is a physical commodity. We use 20x more energy to extract copper yet they never complain about that. Funnily enough, if gold requires more energy to extract process than Bitcoin does to run, then copper requires as much energy for the same thing as what India consumes. India, the 2nd largest country in the world with 1.2B people. Considering tiny Chile is responsible for 25% of global copper production, I highly fucking doubt it. \"It's a small price to pay to secure a worldwide payment network!\" -- Bitcoin is a horrendous payment network, as very few people actually use it as a currency, and it shows no sign of transitioning from a speculative asset to a currency (percentage-wise). In fact, the opposite has been observed over time. It also assumes that greener alternatives (while remaining decentralized) aren't available or possible, even though we have never seen other networks run on the same scale to confirm or debunk that statement. \"Countries like Portugal and Switzerland don't use that much energy, the U.S. uses 65x more!\" -- Misses the point completely. Bitcoin is basically useless if you compare it to the value produced by, say, a 160M+ people country like Bangladesh, yet it requires more power. Eliminate every single item from your life that's been produced/assembled in Bangladesh and let me know how that goes. ---- The conclusion is simple: oldschool PoW architecture is outdated and inefficient. Bitcoin is being propped up by people who have a vested interest in its short-term leadership, because it's crystal clear that it won't make it on the long term. Its original philosophy has been completely destroyed. It's now just another financial asset people are holding to make money."

And there are ways to even take things completely off the grid, so to speak. Just having that option right now is great. Does it come with risks? Yep. But so does having a safe full of silver.

We should continue to remind users both new and old of the censorship in /r/bitcoin and how /r/btc and Bitcoin Cash came to exist. Otherwise it makes no sense for Bitcoin Cash to exist. From a user perspective it's easier to fall into Core's lies: - Roger Ver created Bitcoin Cash to get rich quick - Bitcoin Cash is a shameless copy paste clone, but not Litecoin lol versus the truths: - Roger Ver only supported Bitcoin Cash once SegWit2x failed. He had nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash's creation - Bitcoin Cash chose to fork to scale properly via big blocks. Fast forward to today and Bitcoin Cash delivered on it's promise of low fees and SegWit+LN on Bitcoin are 18 months of excuses. the key difference is still preaching this but quickly identifying which users are genuine and new and which are trolls dragging you down and wasting your time.

Gold bugs are popping champagne bottles, and dancing in the streets in utter glee, as they should. They’ve had to be very patient in the gold market, and it’s wonderful for gold investors that they’re finally seeing some light at the end of the tunnel and not another oncoming train. Let’s put that into perspective from valley to peak. Bitcoin, over the same period of time, has been up well over 300%. So, in terms of bitcoin as a tool for a store of value, as a hedge against an erosion in value of paper money… Because, that’s what the world is afraid of right now. They’re afraid that we have so much fiat currency in the world, that you have $15 trillion of bonds trading at a negative yield. Which means the borrowers—the people who are borrowing—are getting paid to borrow. That’s insane. It’s nuts. It is an indictment on the way the world views fiat currency. There’s a reason why central banks are buying more gold now than in any other time in my lifetime. (I’m almost 50.) It’s because they are—in my opinion—enacting one of the greatest thefts in human history. They are taking essentially worthless bits of paper that they print and have complete control over, and they are exchanging essentially cowry shells for something that has real value. And that is gold. You have to ask yourself, why are they doing that? They are doing that, because I believe the fundamental value of fiat currency will erode and will erode traumatically. It will be something that you just wake up… and it happens."

Uh, yeah, segwit2x pretty much proved that BTC will never actually make any improvements because the community can easily be mislead by the lies of a small number of people. Lies that you, undoubtedly, still believe. ETH is so good they are in the process of redoing the whole thing! The raw numbers say ETH 1.0 is good. Eth 2.0 has even better economics, not that I would expect you to understand that. Tell me, what are the buy/sell economics of a proof of stake system, again? I'm also justifying my wrong choices? ETH is at about 1/5th of its ATH value and BTC is at half the value of its ATH. Which was the overvalued? ETH was the overvalued because it went from $10 to $1200 in a little over a year. That's just common sense, good job? But it did that... because it was undervalued. And I actually missed it, completely. I didn't pay attention to the fundamentals, I was quite literally thinking exactly like you, using the exact same logic. I won't make that mistake again. Looking at the depth of the fall is misleading. Markets take a very long time to figure out the real value of a thing. For the first two years of Bitcoin's existence it was worth less than $1. But fundamentals don't lie. Buy/sell pressure doesn't lie. Human impulses don't lie. you believe in coordination of a bunch of mislead people, with no knowledge at all, by marketing No marketing is needed. High fees are high fees. You are the one who misleads about high fees, not marketing or me. People coordinate because that is the nature of people. They make decisions based on what other people are doing. appealing to your logical hidden side, how will this happen when most don't have $1000 saved to show if an emergency happens? The same way Amazon and Walmart are the the largest retailers on the planet, yet they focus almost exclusively on selling cheap products to Joe rather than expensive products to Dan. I'm not even sure what the last 4 sentences you wrote have anything to do with anything. It's like you believe that BTC is the only thing on the planet that has no inflation or better economics than fiat currencies - Again, reshaping reality to fit with your religious conclusions."

I certainly don't think it's a right, I think it's just a good plan and a novel idea to counteract some severe societal ills that will ultimately follow.

I also am not arguing against the effectiveness of ringct, so far it’s remained untracable. But you are just spreading misinformation. The possible mixins are not the anon set, as only a fixed (10) amount of mixins are included in a transaction. The issue is that you don’t know what ‘anon set’ means. the anonimity set is the number of possible outputs that could be responsible for a single transaction. In Zcash this is every tx that entered the shielded pool minus any tx that left and could be linked to one that entered the pool. In Monero it’s the 11 members of a ringsignsture in a transaction. I’m also not basing my ideas on Zcash linkability on ‘beliefs’ , there are a number of research papers that worked on that. Also note that none of them were able to trace shielded transactions in any way what so ever. Once again this is false, the anon set does not grow in xmr unless the amount of mixins per tx is increased. There are a couple of proposals that could achieve a 10x increase, namely omniring and ringct 3.0, due to increased verification efficiency and reduced sizes for the ringsignatures."

Pick projects with active communities or ample funding, strong fundamentals and good use cases and you shouldn't need worrying about that. Disagree. The projects don't just disappear, all that happens is that the exchange volume goes to zero and more bagholders get disillusioned as bitcoin forces their coins to shed sats when it pumps and when it dumps. Volume declines. Bagholders get stuck with huge stacks that would clear the orderbook. The team gets less active, the community dries up. I lived it. By the sound of things you'll live it too.

  "reddit": "I hadn't taken a good look at Syscoin yet, so I jumped into their website. Found something that irked me a bit though. They are being incredibly misleading about their TPS claims. Since they make such a song and dance about that in particular, it's an adequate shitcoin indicator for me personally. You can judge for yourself: ----- The is 60158 TPS which was apparently recorded by Whiteblock during a \"cloud simulation of a live production network.\" Whiteblock tested the network using 30 nodes (24 master nodes, 3 senders, 3 receivers). In the control group with 0 latency between nodes, Z-DAG clocked 145k, 111k, and 114k TPS. We find 60158 TPS in a test varying the number of assets, with that number as the top result (45k, 47k, 60k). The latency between those 30 nodes in this test? 24ms. That's a considerable decrease for not a lot of latency, fortunately Whiteblock tested this too. In three tests with latency at 50ms, 100ms, and 150ms, Z-DAG recorded 15k TPS, 7K TPS, and apparently failed on the third. Expecting 100ms ping for Z-DAG to function means it is not going to work at all in the real world. Even if the failure was a one-off, that is a massive decrease in the advertised TPS in massively unrealistic network circumstances. But let's go further. Whiteblock also tested what happens when you change the number of nodes. This time, they tested with 4, 9, and 14 masternodes at 24ms latency. The TPS? 38k, 35k, then 28k. So if the network decentralizes, TPS gets killed (whether by number of nodes or communication time between them). Since this is the parameter that they base their entire market cap off, it's not looking good. Amusingly, this also noted by Whiteblock: it is important to note that these tests were designed only to observe the practical performance of Syscoin’s Z-DAG implementation and not the Syscoin platform as a whole. As such, these results should only be considered to reflect the capabilities of said implementation and may not be indicative of the holistic performance of the platform itself. So they weren't even testing Syscoin as an actual, usable network; just Z-DAG itself. What happened to a \"live production network\" heh. And God forbid the small pool of nodes on this network end up more than 100ms of latency apart, Syscoin's TPS might go into the negative. It's a no from me. ----- TL;DR - Did anyone actually from Whiteblock? Holy shit, they are waving it around like a badge of honour when in reality it is incredibly damning."

  "reddit": "I actually watch a lot of crypto Youtubers, and the reason they don't hype nano is, they are mostly Bitcoin maximalists, except for the sad sacks that hype XRP (seriously, $10,000 XRP ?!?). Its MINDSHARE, most people talk about Bitcoin, because most viewers know about Bitcoin. Most of the altcoin talk on Youtube is making fun of scams, and shilling. Take Tixl (please) This new alt has been shilled like crazy recently by many crypto Youtubers. Why ? Because they are either investors in the coin, or they can make money on their referral link, which they make sure you know is there. The pitch is like this 'Tixl is just like nano, but also private' (!!) The funny part of the pitch is, Tixl is banned as a security in the US, AND does not actually function as a crypto at the moment, but is purely a placeholder token. In other words, its fundamentals are terrible, insiders own it all, its totally centralized, KYC is required, and it doesn't even do ANY of what it is hyped to do. But you know what Tixl DOES do ? It PAYS for people to shill it, and in the end, THAT is what the crypto influencers actually care about, besides what Bitcoin is doing. Its kind of a chicken and egg problem with all 'deep alts'. Why talk about an alt that isn't either paying you, going up already, or a blatant scam ? There is no reason to mention it, so they don't, unless they can sell another shitcoin for profit, based on nano's functionality (Tixl)"

Which is not true and can't be true. It's just kicking the can down the road. W/e computing task can be done in software and via general hardware can be done much faster and better on dedicated ASIC or FPGA hardware. Shortly put: If any old CPU can perform said task, doesn't matter if the task algo changes, a dedicated FPGA or ASIC with all those algos implemented will do it much faster than a CPU will. None of the articles explanations, actually explain in detail what common CPU registers will be used that cannot be emulated or copied to an ASIC layout.

The projections are very rough, possibly off by decades because conditions can change. Why are the white supremacists doing this to themselves? Answer: White supremacy is a conspiracy theory used against white nationalism. It's a carbon copy of \"Zionist world order\", which was a conspiracy theory used against Jewish nationalism. If you were to argue that you're against those specific forms of nationalism I would not consider you a conspiracy theorist because there are very real movements to create a white Japan-style nation/safe haven somewhere on Earth. \"White supremacy\" is an absurd conspiracy theory where people who believe in their superiority and run major Western institutions... Promoted slavery, globalization and mass immigration. Have been disproportionately interracially raped/murdered for over a decade with no serious complaint. Etc. It just wasn't and isn't a thing. That was all the product of early market economics crushing tribalism and people intermingling in reckless ways with no consideration of the long-term consequences to make an easy dollar. I feel like I'm repeating myself, but, \"white supremacists\" seems to be the left wing name and \"globalists\" seems to be the right-wing name. They both hate the same group of people (those who promote mass population transplants turn them into mistreated laborers) but came up with different names."

Unfortunately it's an OG of pay2win which means it get lumped in with the stench of the other AAA. Regardless, you may want to focus on console games from before 2000 to satisfy those requirements. 2000 was certainly the golden era. To me, 2010 will be known as the decade of mobile trash clones and surprise mechanics. I won't support proprietary systems so consoles aren't an option. If I'm desperate then i'll emulate. What I buy these days is mostly quality indie games. I suppose you could check out the few games that have integrated KIN. Beat a level, earn kin. Use kin for new skins, new levels. Get an item you dont like? Trade it to another player for kin, etc. Costs you zero and you can earn and spend real crypto. Sounds more like a skinner box than a game. I play games for entertainment, and not be a cog in a wheel where my time is economically valued. It's the difference between reading a book vs filling out a survey for a virtual item to sell amazon coins. Sadly that's the state the industry is in, It's surprising gamers are content with that after years of it."

Contrary to its reputation (and widespread adoption by pirates, scammers and thieves), Bitcoin is not and has never been private. Blockchain uses what's called a \"public ledger\" for its databases. This means that everyone can see what happens inside each block of data. This is key to the format's security, but it also means that the default setting for privacy is nil. With Bitcoin, anyone can see a record of every account that has owned, sent and received each individual bitcoin for that entire token's existence. Now, users can falsify their account information to hide their identities, but the account itself is a public record. This is how Monero seeks to set itself apart. It disguises each record of transactions and ownership, relying most notably on a process called the \"ring signature.\" This signature is a key that the blockchain database generates during a transaction. When a user receives a ring signature, it is essentially a way of saying that the transaction has been verified as legitimate by the database without revealing the user who verified it."

Using cryptocurrency allows us to take it anywhere and have the ability to use it or switch it to a county's currency to spend. That helps against paying fees on sending or trading currencys themselves. I just want to not be fucked, but we seem to be digging a hole that will lead us to be fucked later on."

It makes payments fast and easy. It's a pretty good, simple and a clear proposition that is not so obvious because crypto is not in the payment stage yet. Also It has a solid tech (basically the same as Bitcoin) that has never been threatened before. Few cryptos can say that. And yet these same similarities with Bitcoin are also what might make someone think Its redundant. My opinion is that the silver to Bitcoin's gold is a good metaphor. Bitcoin doesn't work for fast transactions and Litecoin does. That has value. The bottom line is that, like every crypto, Its value relies on the community that supports it, and Litecoin has one of the most diehard userbase I've seen in the space. They have been to almost every bubble. They have seen Charlie Lee leave twice (he \"left\" when he went to work for Coinbase, and when he sold). They have seen r/litecoin have one or two posts a day, on a good day, and they were not even related to litecoin, It was so \"dead\". And yet they never left. They never doubted nor blinked for a second, and that absolute perseverance in Litecoin is something maybe only Bitcoin has. \"buy\"buy\"buy!\""

Those people re-invest any money they make after paying for hardware and electricity, Back into more miners. This cycle repeats until there is only a few small select group which control the majority of the hash rate. I'd much rather support XRPs Consensus method because people are not directly financially compensated via block rewards, It is more secure and has less vulnerabilities (cant be 51% attacked) is faster, more scalable, more efficient on power and even hardware costs are ultra low. over time it has become the most decentralized network that exists. You also have A holder of the majority of the coins using money to Invest and increase adoption of the network and its protocols, instead of the majority of the \"money\" made from the network going to ASIC devs and power companies.... People wonder recently Why There are no LTC devs? The reason is because the money goes to the miner and they dont care to fund Devs, they care to acquire more and more hashrate."

I guess if you do the math you are technically correct... although its extremely misleading and a very biased statement. If you look at how much BCH has dropped from its all time high and how much it has recovered, BTC is clearly the winner. BCH still needs to increase in price 1000% to compare to its ATH, while BTC only needs a 50% increase to recover... BTC Peaked at $20,089 in December 2017 it is currently worth $10,348 a 49% decrease. BTC Bottomed out at $3,284 around December 2018, it is currently worth $10,348 a 315% increase since the bottom. BCH Peaked at $4,355 in December 2017 it is currently worth $314 a 93% decrease. BCH Bottomed out at $81 around December 2018, it is currently worth $314 a 387% increase since the bottom.

If Congress opened up national voting to some technology standard, how many bad blockchains would appear from the void, throwing cash at geriatric men who don't know what they are supporting? Countless. And do we believe that Congress will vote for an open Ethereum BC that nobody is lobbying for (nobody benefits dearly if ETH is selected, but a dozen guys benefit monstrously if Private System XYZ gets chosen, therefore Private System XYZ enjoys more lobbying effort). If Private System XYZ is chosen, then it will be illegal to look at the source code to verify what's happening, so we have to rely on those who work at Private System XYZ to tell us that we're getting what we paid for. If, by some miracle, an open source blockchain is chosen, what are the chances it is written in a commonly understood language like JavaScript? If it isn't, how many people can read solidity or some other obscure programming language? If it is written in a commonly understood language, how many people will actually audit the code themselves? How many will actually look that this computer made this input that got recorded as this vote? Versus, how many will read a third party review and leave it at that? And even still, if lots of knowledgeable people can audit the code, and do audit the code, how many bad actors would it take to cast doubt over what they say? Well, we know that most people read headlines and don't read articles. We know that most people get their news from Facebook and not specialty sources, and we know that sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic for the average nobody... So how much effort would it take a Russia or a China or a Facebook to cast serious doubts about the validity of an election to a population who has to rely on a fairly small number of experts, who may themselves not verified the code? Or, stick with what has basically worked for 2000 years which is: Have average people with no specialized knowledge man voting stations, populate the polling stations with a number of people with conflicting interests, have them transport the votes in a verifiable way that will be difficult to subvert, and almost impossible to subvert large-scale, have the votes counted in front of large audiences who are also adversaries (ideally on camera with a live feed).(?) One system requires people going out of their way to educate themselves on how a magical black box works, and the other has never been subverted on a large scale if adhering to a few simple rules. The assumption we have to make is: this pot of gold is so valuable that any weakness should be viewed as potentially fatal. The solution is to be as inclusive of everyone as possible, include the maximum number of eyes and the simplest, most widely understood forms of verification. Which means paper and pencil."

  "reddit": "I'm reading the report with much facepalming, such as : We searched for a comprehensive technological analysis of XRP’s consensus mechanism, but one does not currently exist. Seriously, they think that no-one has ever done an analysis of the ledger? I did a single google search and immediately found with zero effort. I can't imagine how low effort their own search must have been. They include this gem of a quote which claims to explain why XRP is centralised: The software indicates that four of the five keys are required to support a proposal in order for it to be accepted. Since the keys were all downloaded from the Ripple.com server, Ripple is essentially in complete control of moving the ledger forward, so one could say that the system is centralised. Indeed, our node indicates that the keys expire on 1 February 2018…, implying the software will need to visit Ripple.com’s server again to download a new set of keys. Anyone can download and run a Validator, it's open source, and open sourced on GitHub. That's not even taking into account how out-of-date the quote is, given that it refers to keys expiring in early 2018... Then they discuss the different Ripple technologies as though they are also crypto based (hint, they are not - and have never pretended to be). The report also says things like: Several of the 2018 court cases regarding Ripple are because of the escrow account. The news of the escrow account made the price shoot up, and many investors are claiming that Ripple Labs profited financially by manipulating the price and investors I held XRP at the time the escrow was announced, and you can be sure that everyone in the community was keen to see a siginificant price spike from the announcement - we were disappointed (XRP did however rise to exceptional highs later in the crypto bubble - but the escrow announcement itself didn't make a significant difference at the time it was announced). They also attempt to highlight the court cases that Ripple has fought, as though it's uncommon for companies to have to fight in court: All of Ripple Labs Inc. shenanigans has led to 16 court cases in the United States and multiple encounters with regulators in other countries. Table 1 outlines the major cases that Ripple Labs has fought in the US. Then then go to list 17 cases (implying they can't count) and In 4 of these cases Ripple was the plaintiff. Of the remaining 13 cases, there are only 10 unique plaintiffs, implying that these were appeals etc. They also put a \"result\" for each case, which is actually nothing to do with the result of any given case, it was just the description of the case. For example the Ryan Coffey cases were dropped when they went to federal court (against Ryan's wishes to keep it in State court). I could go on, but I have other things to do - suffice to say this is a badly research trash report spreading FUD. I hope these few highlights make that clear."

This is where a lot of the confusion arises from people saying 'BCH is bitcoin'. That phrase does not mean BCH is 'bitcoin' the cryptocurrency, but BCH is another bitcoin network, adhering to the bitcoin ideology, some would say more closely. The most optimal solution after the fork would have been for the BTC fork to also change its name from 'bitcoin', since there was now more than one bitcoin protocol network. Roger and many in the BCH community believe this to be a more realistic and fair solution than dropping 'bitcoin' from 'bitcoin cash', so they call the btc fork bitcoin core, considering the bitcoin core client is used by 95% of all BTC miners."

Many of them have delegated, in passing, to Binance, by depositing their funds there. Binance makes $500m-$1b per year from running a trusted exchange. How much do you think Binance would want to throw away the next 10 years profits by destroying their reputation with a bribe? $10b? (Oh - not forgetting they'd also be class-action sued for fraud, and prosecuted.)"

That doesnt change the fact that cash is anyomous at all even if there is central control. If satoshi or the \"Creators\" came back(The worst that could possibly happen in your view) as you make sound like a problem or is \"Scary\" because we don't know who he is that doesnt change anything about opensource projects and any opinion would just be a creators \"Opinion\" all the coins could be sold and it wouldn't matter for shit. The creators opinion could maybe have an impact on bitcoin because well they or him developed it but that doesnt mean he will have an impact on what is already developed outside of Bitcoin and suddenly give \"Central authority\" as you make it sound. Monero is a perfect example of what cash is today while being open source project it will go no where on the return of Satoshi and no one can stop it unless it is exploited. Hasn't happened yet probably wont happen for the years to come and Btc is still around after all these years. I still dont fucking think you know what open source means it's literally a joke commenting back to you because your argument is that \"Its worrying no body knows who satoshi is\" when source code cannot be changed without majority of miners making their own decision of what they want to use so what the fuck does that say about every other project in the ecosystem? There is a reason why no one knows who satoshi is... most likely for anonymity purposes as people would be prying at him for the rest of his life or because he knew people would have labeled the project as \"bad\" for years because of the anomity factor and bitcoin isn't even an anyomous coin anymore so Monero at this point is a clearer picture of what bitcoin should of been so does that mean Monero is just as bad? 2 of the 7 original developers are identified people working on an anyomous opensource project..... It's like you think bitcoin is the only project in the whole ecosystem like holy shit bitcoin is an idea that was put together with what was technologically available in that time frame with many other identified people helping just no one knew the creator. Who gives a fuck? Then you go on to say we are moving to a \"More Decentralized era\" when no company, bank or the internet is really decentralized and blockchain isn't even a working product that can be utilized properly for decentralizing applications or even work as intended in 2008 because of huge scalability problems. Decentralization is an idea that will most likely rapidly change human civilization for the better while wiping central authority away. Also from what you're saying about banks in simple form is that money is power which at this point you're not wrong but money and power will have little to 0 impact on an opensource decentralized project that is not suffering from the critical issues we face today which is mainly scaling who can be the largest contributor to the network some projects may even have solutions already just developing doesn't happen in a tomorrow as rushed projects have a higher chance of failure(Ethereum(IDENTIFIED DEVELOPER) failed but it didn't stop vitalik from bringing Ethereum to where it is today) . Money and power can ruin a project like Bitcoin but so much $$ is required that no one has even done it today otherwise Bitcoin the leader of all projects would be dead already."

This can lead to some conflict with various contributor in regards to the route the cryptocurrency should take. This can lead to \"forking\" splitting the cryptocurrency into different implementation and the users get to decide which path to take, an example would be Bitcoin (BTC) aka Bitcoin core and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Of course the first thing to address is who is \"the government\". When asking the question \"is X legal?\", the responding question should always be \"where?\". Assuming you're in the US, my guess would be generally the money is yours and you just need to claim it and pay taxes... concerning federal law... I would imagine you could run afoul of local municipal and state laws involving found property. For instance Georgia's law seems to be broad and fuzzy enough to give you pause on the threat of the hassle (and possible felony conviction). Beyond the possible criminal charges, in practice if a large legit corporation made an error they would pursue every avenue available to recoup their funds after discovering their mistake including civil litigation. They would probably attempt to come to a closed settlement with you to reclaim some of their loss, avoid you both spending exorbitant amounts on lawyers, and to keep their name out of the news for the whole debacle. If the Bitcoin's previous owner was of the disreputable variety, it would almost certainly end up being more of a curse than a blessing. The government will definitely at least investigate you for money laundering (and probably much more). The previous owner of the bitcoin would not necessarily have the same access to your KYC information to try to tie the bitcoin address to your real identity but the threat of them coming for you would be enough to dissuade you from \" just keep\\[ing\\] them and sell them for fiat money\". Concerning your prompt (i.e. just spending the bitcoin without a care in the world), I'd say. \"naw. probably not.\" In practice, I think most people would attempt to obfuscate the funds or else anticipate the fallout and consult with a cyber security firm and/or lawyer."

For all the noobs out there that are getting ripped up here are some tips. 1. Recognize where the market is at. It will be clear when markets are in clear down swings and clear upswings. Do not sell or trade during \"Bart Season\" unless you think the environment is too dangerous. Trade when there are clear upswings and downswings and you will make much more consistent cash. 2. Take your time when you buy and sell! Wait a day or two on buying /selling something once it has made a big change. Usually, the price will stabilize. People get too emotional and will sell at 10%-20% losses for what they could get for the coin 2 days later. For example the last crash Eth went down to about $190 and went back up to $230. That's a a 20% difference. That being said it's not always going to work out, but overall it puts you in a better place to make more logical trades. 3. Be patient. Don't trade because you are bored or the market is not making any moves. One or two coins might go up drastically during a flat market, but you will get burnt more often than not when you hunt for those coins. Wait for the market and take advantage of it. It may take years of waiting for another bull market. 4. If you must go after those coins that have potential of 100x 1. Wait until the next bull market (may be years or never). 2. Since this market is relatively new and no usable product has come out of it, I have noticed that the idea of the project and the marketing of the project is much more valuable than the actual product.. Pretty much if you think people will like the idea of the project and/or think they will think it has a future then buy it. Do not get too attached to the project and sell it once it starts flagging. With this strategy you may not hit the peak price of a coin, but you can still make good returns more \"safely\"."

The divergence between the prices of the pool’s underlying assets can lead to liquidity providers suffering “impermanent loss”. This loss can exceed accumulated fees, so that when liquidity providers withdraw their liquidity (by selling the Relay Token) they are worse off than if they had just held the two assets on their own. Sounds like Bancor is working on a solution though. The post says: “Stay tuned for new tools coming soon which will allow liquidity providers to easily track these price movements and optimize Relay Token returns.”"

Even with crypto in some countries are asking KYC or its a nono for exchanges, so everyone is tracked down... If privacy would be so important Monero should be #1 coin by far. I understand your point, but the majority of the world doesnt care for it, they will take digital payments if they life gets more simplified (Same as people giving all their information in social media, OK to Apps requests on reading messages, contacts, etc...).

For example, Coinpit did not utilize Pre-Signed Future Deposit Guarantees, and, correct me if I'm wrong, provided signed, local, ready-to-broadcast reversal transactions to users in a manner that allowed them to take back their deposits at anytime, even if they had already placed a trade. With Kapitalex, the user cannot simply \"reverse\" trades at a whim once a deposit has been made and signed, and a trade already completed. Once a trade is final, it's final, and even if the user doesn't want to comply, after the 30-day Future Deposit Guarantee matures, Kapitalex will be able to recover the funds, as needed. Also, the user isn't allowed to make any withdrawals, until he or she balances the wallet, i.e., sign off on any Multisignature funds that were traded upon/sold."

  "reddit": "Very unlikely. The wave 4 of one lesser degree was around 1,8k. That is a reasonable target if this is a B wave. This parabola could easily provide the necessary energy to break below 3k. A lot of novice investors have been lured into the crypto markets during the past 6 months. These people have no idea how to read a chart, how to isolate order blocks, how to read candles and PA, how to track algorithms, how to use Elliott Wave, how market cycles work or how to trade patterns. These people bought BTC during a parabolic run. They spot bought BTC at insane prices, such as 10K, 11K, 12K, 13K, 14k etc. They don't use stops or risk management. They blindly hold onto a bag with the belief that one day BTC is going to 100K. These people are needed to drive the price lower. When BTC drops to the 6Ks these people will panic and this energy could be sufficient to push price lower than 3K. When a market (particularly cash markets) does not hit its intended target at the first attempt, it is necessary for the market makers to force price higher in order to achieve lower prices. If you look at ETH, where are you seeing major support below the yearly low? It's around $15 and $21 marks the top of wave 1."

Yet despite this (which clearly played a larger role than the moderation policy of a single rubreddit), you couldn't coordinate any consensus for your change. I'll say it again, reddit is meaningless. No technical coordination has even taken place exclusively on reddit. Own up to the fact that you couldn't get support for your desired change. Accept the fact that the Core developers have no obligation to implement or support your changes. Acknowledge that in a consensus network, the burden lies completely on the party who wants to fork away from the status quo. You failed on accepting these facts. You failed to gain support. You can choose to blame one subreddit, or you can man up, and accept that even two years later, no one cares about BCH. You were never more than a vocal minority. Move on man. Seriously."

Satoshi was a technological genius there’s no way he wouldn’t be aware that tech becomes obsolete very quickly in today’s day and age. And I truly do feel like within 5-10 years Bitcoin will become so obsolete that it will fall from grace. In fact I don’t see any real bull runs for Bitcoin in the future.

Then you have ETH - you know what ETH is? It's water. It's what crypto is supposed to be without all of the added bullshit, like producing more CO2 than medium sized European countries. It flows through pipes without eroding them but is a powerful force over time that should not be reckoned with. The ICOs of Ethereum are the consumers who drink it - not all good, but not all bad.

US based blockchain companies suffer from the decreased usage, putting them at a global first-mover disadvantage due to a lack of consumer usage.

Telegram chat confirmed LTC has been dead in the water for 2 years and the creator couldn't care less, citiing \"decentralization\".

  "reddit": "As numerous people have told you numerous times - it’s hilarious that proving someone’s existence is a milestone to you and the team. Y’all are parading it around like a badge of honor; as if you are heroes - for proving someone exists... The video proves absolutely nothing other than Borz exists. Wow! It doesn’t prove any bit of the tech exists at all. Xtrabytes again releases something that is not pertinent to the tech whatsoever and does nothing to prove the existence of Zoltchain. You want to talk about my ‘inferior knowledge’ of crypto and the crypto world when you are part of a closed source project! �� You are part of a project that goes against one of the foundational philosophies of crypto. Please share your superior knowledge and inform me how it’s possible that two different chains can each have a completely identical address. That’s what your team claims - XFuel is running a different chain than Xtrabytes and that chain is using PoSign, but holders do not need to change their address to interact with the second, different chain... how is that possible? It’s not. Just like it’s not possible for two households to have the exact same street address in the same city and state, and with the same ZIP, or how two people can’t have the same email address. Addresses are unique values. Please also inform me how Zoltchain will be QR by use of SHA-512 when SHA-512 is a complete unnecessary sig hash and more like a buzzword your team used to trick people who don’t have knowledge of the subject matter. There is literally no reason to use SHA-512. It is not secure against even current regular computers. It will NOT be resistant against QC. There have been flaws and holes found in all SHA-2 hash functions. If you and your team knew a damn thing and really wanted to make it secure, you’d use SHA-3. I don’t need to show my face or my LinkedIn. I didn’t start a crypto ‘project’ aka scam and lie to the public and make exaggerated, grandiose claims to lure the public into investing and buying coins that I held the entire supply of after scamming people with a fake ICO. I haven’t committed fraud. I didn’t ‘incorporate’ a company in an offshore tax haven that is considered non-compliant by international authorities. I didn’t shill my ‘project’ with a bunch of unverifiable and bullshit lies all over every forum I could for months on end with absolutely no proof to back it up so I could trick people into investing. That was all Xtrabytes. That was all you and your team of conartists. I have absolutely no reason to expose my own personal information, just like 99% of the users on this site. Right, right. I’m sure that’s the honest truth. Xtrabytes is a beacon of honesty. Ooook. ���� Great personal attack. Always with the “no life” bullshit. 1. What I do on my own time is my own business. It is absolutely none of your concern. 2. I’m not at all sorry you’re upset that it gets in the way of your scam. 3. Since you’re responding to all my comments, then that means you have no life as well... pretty simple logic there. �� Though, I know logic is not your strong point. Pretty funny and ironic considering you’re apparently Greek. Nope. Don’t need to know your favorite color. I already know it’s whatever color Dave’s eyes are. So, now please explain and answer my two questions. Btw, what’s up on that mobile app that was apparently ready for release 2/10/19 but is now on the FOURTH beta round and still not released?? What happened to the patent applications being completed and PP status granted in late February/early March? How is it that with both of these things, they were apparently finished but now, 4-6 months later, are still allegedly being worked on?"

So your “burden of proof” has shown what we know: the btc network is running fine right now, but it’s barely below the threshold where shit hits the fan.

  "reddit": "Dan doesn't care about making BTC more scarce. Wealthy people are far, far more likely to diversify their investments. I don't know how would you call investing in a money to replace them all a ponzi scheme or a thing that rich would have not interest in. Making bitcoins scarce is the result of people hoarding it, not that they care about it. I don't know where you assumed Joe earns more. My point was that one is rich and the other is not, but you included an income to say otherwise. Human behavior is coordinated. If it wasn't, gold wouldn't have become more valuable than salt, copper, or bronze and humans couldn't have formed cities and societies. And ETH and then there's LTC. But none of these matter to me, not even DOGE coin, I'm going to print my own coin! I'll tell my neighbor to do the same. Each country have their own currencies, why can't each individual print their own too? Do you realize that the market tends to the most scarce items? Do you realize that the cost of another, digital, coin is zero? This makes coordination to take over BTC impossible. Do you know how many centuries it took Europe to switch from silver coins branded from roman times to gold? But suppose they invent a better coin tomorrow, do you know how easy it will be to copy BTC's UTXO and insert it there with the same monetary policy? It is not about coordination, this game is over. Destroy the internet is the only game you can play if you want to destroy BTC. They're going to save into the same coin they can USE. Usage of coin is bad since it destroys its value. BTC is for storage, you can dump fiat for now. This is the reason Dan is much more important to BTC than Joe. For one thing, they're most likely to converge on the most useful coin which has the highest number of transactions and businesses adopting it. Ethereum. A coin where some russian can change its thing because you took contracts too literally? A coin whose greatest success was almost complete halt under the weight of... cryptokitties? I'm not worried about this, sorry. Society will adapt to fax machines, they don't need email. Society does adapt to guns and industrial waste and radioactivity. This is the sort of adaptation: no one is going to make guns don't kill, their purpose is killing fast."

Immutable transparency is attractive. how they are expecting to profit from their share holdings (undisclosed amount) in VeChain Global Technology Holding Limited? You could google a video on how shares work and that'd save us both time really. has the vechain foundation undergone a financial audit by a reputable western auditor (kpmg, ernst young)?

In 08 you had people taking out loans so that they could refinance in a year or two to pull equity out despite not putting more than 3% down because the value was appreciating so quickly. Now no one can get a housing loan without a proof of income or job. Coupled with the fact that we are only now seeing a return to the housing valuations of 11 years ago despite the stock market tripling in that time frame. Meaning that today's housing prices aren't nearly overvalued as they were during the great recession"

  "reddit": "You do not need a massive server farm to run a node that processes 100 MB blocks. A basic understanding of modern computer hardware and consumer bandwidth would tell you that. You can cherry pick all your videos you want. I can find videos of big blockers explicitly telling people not to run nodes, and instead rely on 3rd parties, exactly the situation that crypto is supposed to avoid. I never said you need a massive server farm to run a node. But even with 1mb blocks, people aren't running nodes RIGHT NOW. You are trying to make it a technical issue. Its not a technical issue. Its a social issue. People aren't running nodes right now even with the light requirements needed. If you increase blocksize 100x, people are going to be even LESS LIKELY to run a node. Do you run one? Why not? Because of a technical issue of diskspace or bandwith? I doubt it. Probably simply because you just can't be inconvenienced. Big blockers explicitly ENCOURAGE CENTRALIZATION: They tell newbies that they don't need to run nodes. Like almost everybody opposed to Bitcoin's original large block scaling roadmap, you don't really seem to actually think cryptocurrencies are all that useful or seem to value the idea of mass adoption. I said I'd like to see mass adoption, but that's not my end goal. I don't care much either way. What I do care about is the cyberpunk values that bitcoin was created for: that is freedom from censorship and freedom from inflation. I will not compromise those values for some goal of worldwide adoption. Ensuring our freedoms are guaranteed comes first; scalability comes second. Once we can ensure that, THEN we can look at scaling. Telling people to centralize by not running nodes puts those freedoms at risk, and for what, faster and cheaper txns? But that's what you want to do: Risk our freedoms so that people can buy coffees onchain. Guess what? Coffee transactions aren't at risk of censorship, and no one really cares about inflation for a $2 transaction. So there is no need to use decentralization for such a transaction when you have little to no risks. The equivalent would be hosting your home videos over bittorrent. Retarded. No need for decentralization. If anyone could be considered anti-cryptocurrency, its these people. They care more about being paypal2.0 which can handle mass adoption, than they care about freedom. Indeed, grandma would not like to see her life savings devalued and inflated away. And guess what, she can easily move her savings into Bitcoin today, as is, and it works perfectly. In fact plenty of people are already doing that. If she's moving her savings, she doesn't particularly care how long that transaction takes within reason, whether its 10 min or 2 hrs, but she does care whether that transaction can be stopped or censored or reversed. I value the \"stopped or censored or reversed\" part. You value the \"fast and cheap\" part. So go use LTC, or NANO, or BSV, or BCH, or LN, or whatever. You have solutions for your goals."

  "reddit": "I never said you need a massive server farm to run a node. That's what the video claims. The video is ridiculous FUD to try to push a network configuration that sacrifices an enormous amount of usefulness, and in fact forces people to use trusted third parties to hold their BTC due to inadequate on-chain capacity, for an unnecessary amount of full node decentralization. I said I'd like to see mass adoption, but I don't particularly care if it happens or not. That shows a total lack of regard for cypherpunk values. Cypherpunk values mean wanting the tools of censorship resistant finance to be in the hands of as many people as possible. What I do care about is the cyperpunk values that bitcoin was created for: that is freedom from censorship and freedom from inflation. I will not compromise those values for some goal of worldwide adoption. You can't have freedom from censorship when you can't write to the blockchain. 300,000 txs per day means that hardly anyone will be able to get \"freedom from censorship\" using BTC. You're deliberately sacrificing BTC's ability to provide censorship resistance finance, and yet you claim to be a cryptocurrency advocate. Like I said, I don't buy it. Coffee transactions aren't at risk of censorship, and no one really cares about inflation for a $2 transaction. There are the talking points from the anti-cryptocurrency propaganda video again. \"Coffee\" is a stand-in for \"anything\". If you can buy anything with BTC, that means you don't need to use centralized payment processors who can censor you. In countries like Venezuela, where average income is about $2 a day, a \"coffee\" purchase is the equivalent of a day's wage. That's where on-chain transactions are most needed. People making $2 a day can't afford $40 on-chain transaction fees, and asking them to use a trusted third party (TTP) that holds their cryptocurrency on their behalf, is putting them in the same position as they are in right now, where TTPs that are vulnerable to government censorship control their money. Indeed, grandma would not like to see her life savings devalued and inflated away. And guess what, she can easily move her savings into Bitcoin today, as is, and it works perfectly. More lies. Grandma cannot access centralized exchanges in countries where exchanges are censored. The only way grandmas around the world can access BTC is if BTC can be directly used by everyone in the world. With 300,000 txs per day, that's not possible. I can't imagine that you actually want cryptocurrency to make an impact on the world. I can't imagine you don't see the logical holes in your anti-adoption narrative."

Also, the link is an executive summary, and is intentionally as easy to read for laymen as possible. All four papers with the actual research are linked. Overall, it isn't about what functions can or cannot be implemented in an ASIC. RandomX implements many functions, forcing hardware designers to account for them all and making the hardware more complex and impractical. You CAN make a RandomX ASIC. It'll just be wildly expensive and unlikely to earn a return over the same investment in CPUs. Have you looked into the number of algorithms, the memory requirements (including L1 and L2 cache sizes), the fact that it wont work with 32-bit chips, and that it's engineered from the ground-up to make task-switching expensive to do in FPGA hardware? I honestly believe that you are either trolling or shilling, because your posts further up don't even acknowledge RandomX and talk about changing a basic algorithm once every six months, but now, suddenly, you know all about RandomX and have vague criticisms where you link $100 32-bit FPGAs with zero acknowledgement of the reasons that they wouldn't work."

That means stocks, bonds, international markets, real estate etc, cash, crypto etc. 2. invest in yourself and try to acquire a good job. This helps during downtrends. 3. use tax advantage accounts like 401k / IRAs / HSA to reduce to tax exposure 4. If you're dabbling into leverage / loans, make sure you have a clear exit plan involving basic risk management and have enough collateral that your quality of life won't get degraded while paying back the debt. 5. Never ever have high interest debt like credit cards (you're basically giving banks free money while hating on them by investing in crypto). 6. Don't be overemotional and use ideological reasons for chosing any investment. Your alt is in a downtrend and btc is in an uptrend, protect yourself by moving to btc till the downtrend breaks. 7. Break down your investments based on risk factor. Make sure you're okay losing all your money in ultra speculative investments like crypto without impacting your quality of life. These things helped me through the bear market as while my crypto portfolio was dropping, my other investments, monthly salary etc meant I didn't have to change a single thing about my lifestyle."

CAP theorem In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response – without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodesWhen a network partition failure happens should we decide to Cancel the operation and thus decrease the availability but ensure consistency. Proceed with the operation and thus provide availability but risk inconsistency.In particular, the CAP theorem implies that in the presence of a network partition, one has to choose between consistency and availability. Note that consistency as defined in the CAP theorem is quite different from the consistency guaranteed in ACID database transactions. PACELC theorem In theoretical computer science, the PACELC theorem is an extension to the CAP theorem. It states that in case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed computer system, one has to choose between availability (A) and consistency (C) (as per the CAP theorem), but else (E), even when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C). ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^ ^v0.28"

Besides I'm not arguing that the tech is not solid. Im not sure what you are arguing...I posted math showing BTC is a good store of value UNLESS you bought at its all time high which was 1 month of its 120 month lifespan. Again since people don't even use bitcoin they simply hold then the tech behind the coin is of no consequence since it is not put into use Bitcoin is the most traded crypto currency, to say nobody is using it... is as you would say \" a disingenuous argument\", especially when more and more merchants are accepting it every day. Also ask some people in Venezuela about how no one is using it... The tech itself does not add value. Yes it does, having a immutable global ledger that is censorship resistant has lots of value, why can you not understand this? Look at Venezuela, a lot of people are using BTC because the local currency is literally garbage. Having a sound money system is extremely valuable to everyone. You are cherry picking dates. People who bought into the idea that cryptos/bitcoin are \"an investment\" at best are gambling not an investing. YOU are the one cherry picking dates. Pick almost ANY other month for bitcoin and it was a good investment. Just because 1 month of its 120 month lifespan would of been a bad investment, does not mean the other 119 months were a bad idea to invest in it. How is the stock market not gambling? Trillions have been lost \"betting\" on the stock market. Name one store of value that did better than Bitcoin in the last 2-5-10 years?

Here I thought it would end with \"bcash\" vs \"Bitcoin Core\" (since we're using made up names) but nope! Score one for BCH right out the gate! And it was all Bitcoins use of \"bcash\" that started it all huh. All their fault all of this happened. Haha.. Great story.. Very funny. Oh I also like the joke about that ridiculous name \"made more sense\" part. I swear, you could write comedy. It's funny because that's just about the dumbest name ever, and it was clearly chosen under obvious ulterior motives. Nice try. This stuff is gold. Renaming coins like that. Man, my sides. The mad godly power these people have! And how stupid they are at naming things at the same time! I love it! In any case, your reply is not at all related to my point above.

  "reddit": "Awesome, that gives me the background I need. Is it then safe to say that Quant is ultimately dependent on other protocols continuing to improve key aspects like tps and security? Would it not also be more efficient to build an operation in the network instead of using another protocol that sits on top? For example, a smart contract on ETH will be more efficient than Overledger sitting above ETHs network, right? Likewise, an application on Qubic will be more efficiently integrated with IOTAs tangle than something running in Overledger? If I am correct, then is the idea that developers might sacrifice efficiency for adaptability? I think that's useful and brilliant, I'm just trying to understand how this fits into these other protocols."

Bitcoin SV is supported on Reddit by a bunch low-activity accounts that behave like paid sockpuppet accounts used to shill projects.

I'd rather spend my fiat currency for those purchases, since my fiat value is inflated away, and I am punished for saving. Fiat currencies reward people for going into debt.

  "reddit": "But obviously they can't ignore it, if they did, and auditors/regulators found out there was illicit activity, but it was ignored - they are in the shit Yes, and that's the thing - the bank has become the police. Investigations are launched without anyone's knowledge (certainly not the client under suspicion), decisions are made in the background without much accountability outside of the bank's bureaucracy, and the client may or may not be under regular surveillance from the point of a false positive on. Eerily similar to the concept of the , isn't it? Yup, but cash has been a pain to monitor properly. There's a reason why criminals use it whenever possible Of course criminals also want privacy. Good things can and routinely are abused, criminals breathe and eat food too - are we enabling fraud by not heckling the hell out of everyone who shows up at a fast food joint? You can make the exact same argument (as I've brought up in our previous exchange) about digital communication in general; indeed, even physical one. If you can't watch it, then perhaps someone is up to no good? Does it follow, in your mind, that the solution is to strip everyone of their privacy and monitor things constantly? Another example - certainly we know that there is a certain number of pedophiles among us. This means that some parents must be pedophiles. In order to stop the abuse of children, must every family house have a camera with a live feed connected to the state apparatus ? Must every child carry a camera and a microphone? If you can't observe it, it could be happening. Would you be aiding pedophiles by refusing to install cameras and microphones everywhere? Such examples might seem silly, but consider that right now pretty much the same argument is being made in countries like AUS and the UK about end-to-end-encryption; where the state is essentially arguing that you and me have no right to communicate digitally in private; that such ability hampers the state's ability to \"fight terrorism\". To me that is a very silly argument too. Lots of things do that. And it's a good thing that they do, otherwise it would mean an all-powerful government. We've had plenty of that in the 20th century and we know where it leads (nowhere nice). Of course, what happened without much of a fight in the financial world after 9/11 (where the AML stuff really ramped up) is, as far as I can see, just the same argument transposed to finance, and there the battle was lost very swiftly, unfortunately. Now the daily reality for billions of people is financial mass-surveillance, and the shocking, sad part is that for the most part almost no one is even aware of it. Why, in my opinion, is a curious mixture of more or less endless distraction coupled with technological illiteracy. Most people simply cannot visualize the surveillance dragnet, why it must suck all data in, and most importantly what the severe consequences of that will be in the future (and for some people, already, in the present). Is that the sort of society you want for our children? Everything they spend money on is logged for eternity. Every site they visit is logged for eternity. Every friend they have is known to the government. Every book they read. Everywhere they go. To me that seems like a modern-day dystopian scenario, and we are heading there, fast. Not enough people realize, and not enough people care. This, I suspect with a high degree of confidence, will bring us all great problems in the not-so-distant future. Again, I ask you to consider: That we are having this exchange is, at least on my end (no coincidence: I have the against-the-mill opinion here), predicated on the notion that I enjoy anonymity. Voicing such opinions in a system of total control would only bring me trouble, so it seems likely that the result would be silence. Now, you may or may not be swayed (even lightly) by the arguments presented (while I've enjoyed our exchange, I don't think you have been swayed, but that's ok too), but the point is this: we don't have ultimate answers, our society is not the final supreme iteration of human civilization. To move forward we must be able to question orthodoxies, we must be able to do what's forbidden. To control money to the extent that it has been controlled has severe impacts on personal freedom, but they are hard to see - it's much easier to reason about something that once was, but has been destroyed. It's much harder to reason, and defend, hypothetical scenarios that have not come into being because the human-imposed overlay on the base structure of reality has become too rigid/limiting. But I think it's not beyond our powers to try. We have the gift of imagination and reason, after all. It is not necessary to go through a situation first, we enjoy quite some power to try to anticipate it based on first principles. To give a final example, knowing what you know about AML, would you be comfortable sending $10000 to help your good friend Hashish Al Muhammad in Morocco start his business venture?"

  "reddit": "Bitcoin's original plan was to become a peer-to-peer electronic cash used by the whole world, with large blocks that could allow anyone to write on-chain, as the Bitcoin Wiki page on scalability from 2015 shows: The vast majority of the various stakeholders supported this plan, and because the Core development team refused to implement the plan, there was a very popular client called BitcoinXT created by another set of Bitcoin developers to institute the hard fork to significantly raise the block size limit. Everything was going well, with 1. the majority of mining power signalling support, 2. and 3. /r/Bitcoin upvoting XT posts to the top of subreddit's front-page, but then Theymos instituted a censorship regime on /r/Bitcoin and banned anyone who mentioned BitcoinXT: So the very high level of support and communication needed to execute a successful hard fork couldn't be attained, and the 'Bitcoin' branding remained with the chain with the majority hashrate, BTC. BTC is pursuing a different scaling plan, that keeps it limited to 300,000 on-chain transactions a day, and a ridiculous second layer solution called Lightning Network, that has numerous fundamental problems that make it a niche product with limited uses. So with an inability to grow its daily transaction rate above 300,000 a day, and attract more merchants and retail usage, BTC is now a get-rich memecoin, that depends on advocates continually pumping its ability to make people who hold it rich. It has no utility beyond transferring wealth from later investors to earlier investors, aka a ponzi scheme. It has insignificant utility in actual peer-to-peer commence, because it's limited to 300,000 transactions per day. Every other transaction will have to be done on centralized servers, like exchanges. 99.9% of people will never be able to touch BTC."

The fact that you think the Venezuela situation has anything to do with SoV kind of invalidates your argument. Gold is a store of value because gold has intrinsic value. It's useful for electronics, it's useful as jewelry, etc, and there is relatively limited supply. Bitcoin has the limited supply, but if it's not a digital currency, it's just a quaint digital collectible with a crazy unstable price. Anyone treating it as a SoV is out of their gourd.

  "reddit": "There are three important variables at play: Total transaction fees paid per time unit (FEES), Total value stored on the network (MCAP), Transactions per second (TPS). Without the block reward, transaction fees will go way up (in usd terms), but the only thing that matters is what percent of the transacted amount is the FEES. If you move $1m, you don't care about a $1k transaction fee. The energy needed to secure the network (paid for exclusively with FEES, in the absence of a block reward) should also be proportional to the total value stored (MCAP). The question then becomes: Are the FEES people are willing to pay (as a percentage of the transacted amount) enough to secure the MCAP on the network? If not, maybe the FEES (as a percentage of MCAP) can be increased by increasing the transaction capacity (TPS) of the network with some scaling solution. (More TPS = network more useful = more people willing to store value there. Also: higher TPS = higher velocity of coins = lower MCAP can support higher coin gdp = increase FEES relative to MCAP = network more secure.) So whatever scaling solution will be adopted eventually (LN, sidechains, block size increase gasp, etc) could potentially increase the ratio of FEES to MCAP, making the network more secure. Whether people will pay for their coffee with bitcoin, or whether only central banks will be able to transact on chain, will depend on MCAP and TPS. Maybe there is more than one feasible (ie secure, because FEES/MCAP ratio is large enough) point on TPS-MCAP plane. Then it will be a political governance decision, which one to choose. Fun times ahead!"

That would have meant a non-contentious hard fork and us not having this discussion. In an underhanded fashion, you're not even addressing what this discussion is about, which is WHY the majority of hashing power didn't end up supporting the fork. The hard fork was not supported by the majority of the economy, because major players got scared that the threshold of support for a clean hard fork couldn't be reached. One of the key events that led to a loss of confidence in the support-threshold being met was the main forum for Bitcoin communication being censored, and all pro-fork posts being deleted. Your disingenuous mischaracterizations of Bitcoin's history, and attempt to whitewash and minimize the impact of the most active forum becoming totally censored, is unconscionable, and characteristic of the unethical and anti-cryptocurrency behaviour of 1-MB gatekeeper BTC's current leadership. They simply didn't support a contentious hard fork, like the majority of us. They wanted to: they signalled support for it. They didn't end up supporting it because they didn't feel confident it had enough support to be done successfully. And you know what played a key role in them losing confidence? The main communication channel, where people promoted the hard fork and coordinated their promotion of it, becoming censored, and the pro-fork position being banned from it."

I believe Dusk may have some type of slashing, but it would still be resistant to your attack because you don’t know who to bribe. Veil has some PoW blocks too in order to prevent long range attacks, but in pure PoS you can also do this with checkpoints, iirc nxt were the first to do that. There are also new methods developed to do this in a more decentralized manner, like avalanche for instance. nothing-at-stake is also ‘solved’ by being hybrid pos/pow, but imo the theory is way of from practice, because in PoS you have all your money at stake. by attacking the chain you risk massively devaluing this."

However, it does expose people to risk from untrustworthy sources. Perhaps someone running the ID database decides to leak all the associated token addresses for millionaires thereby increasing their chances of kidnapping or phishing attacks. Maybe a facist regime takes control and retroactively targets certain ethnic minorities based on past activity. Fungibility of the token is also called into question. Blacklisting coins because they were once used in a crime without compensating oblivious downstream parties is unfair but hard to fix without allowing full privacy coins.

Thus means it will live on until it get collateralized, which will likely not happen because the person or bot finding it would pay more gas then this (I think) 30% reward. Each operation was already more than a dollar. That's the income people live of for more than a day, so it doesn't scale cost-wise. They consider scaling only in terms of decentralization, security and speed, but not cost :( Not sure what will happen when there are million dollars of open micro cdps which can not be closed net-cost wise. Anyway, this means there is an entire market they miss simply because the stepfix costs. In others words they will likely take a large amount of the cake but also miss quite a huge chunk."

  "reddit": "It should have been apparent from my OP that I'm not a bot. ok, there are several common scenarios but here's one example. The victim will get a telephone call (typically a local number but it can be from anywhere in the country claiming to be the IRS (or equivalent), and they're told that they owe X number of dollars for taxes and that the police are on the way to arrest them. They may or may not identify the person they're calling (depends on the level of the scam) or the address where the person lives, or provide any other sort of information other than the police are on the way. They're provided a way out, that if they pay now prison time is avoided. They're directed to buy Bitcoin and to send the money to a provided Bitcoin account. At least 95% of the population will not fall for this scam at this point, but some do, typically because they've never done their taxes and have no idea how to even start. Once the victim believes that this scenario is true, they are directed not to tell anyone or ask for help, as they're provided a limited time offer that expires the moment somone else finds out, because it's not above board. At least 1% of the population falls for this and pays out. If the victim is on the fence about paying out, these con people may / or may not show up to the door dressed as police with a fake police car, and then once again recreates the same scenario. They'll either direct the person to buy Bitcoin and escort them/help them to do it. I'm not aware of how many people fall for it at this pint, but the success rate is much higher, but it's clear that the victim was scoped out, called, and hacked in order to increase the likelihood of a pay out. Typical payouts can be anywhere from $1k to well over $10k. There are multiple scenarios that are provided depending on the age of the victim. Payouts are also tailored to the apparent wealth of the victim. In all cases though, the victim cannot afford it as they're clearly struggling in one way or another to fall for these traps. The police have no recourse and few options because Bitcoin transactions and accounts are anonymous. The financial system is also of no help for the same reason. The problem is that so many people are affected by this now that it has a cumulative effect on social assistance programs which leads to higher taxes."

 {
  "reddit": "The comments about it here are very excessive, there just has to be that someone in every single thread to bring it up and it puts me off the project entirely because if you say anything against their agenda you just get downvoted. People need to do their own research! I have been here for many years and I didn't even see ETH ever get so hyped, and I have been part of /r/ethtrader when it was around $10 (November/December 2016) But seeing as this is a discussion focued on this coin, I will say the below. Yes, it is fast. But there is no incentive to run a node and support the network, nor can you mine it or acquire it in anyway except if you buy it or someone generously gives you some. This has lead to the current scenario where the top 3 delegates have 40 percent of all the nano. I personally ran my own node for a month and didn't have anyone use it, all it did was use up my bandwidth propagating the database but seeing as I had no delegates it meant I wasn't actually supporting the network, so I just turned it off and have since repurposed the machine. Another point I have been thinking about too is I highly doubt the current users will want to see the price lift off after they just spent all their coins, if it was a network that had the current transaction times but with a stablecoin, I could see it being heavily used. The tokens at one point was $37, would you spend your coins today even if it meant in the future it might hit this price again? Maybe that is why it is mentioned so much, so the price can go up so they can safely offload their coins. EDIT: See, this is exactly what I mean, my post hasn't even been up for an hour and already it has been downvoted, as have my replies. You can't even have a civil conversation about it. EDIT 2: My post and all my replies were negative when I made that first edit..."

If I would have listened to him I would have sold litecoin at $370$380. He congratulated the whole community and told everyone to shave off some profits. He wasn't scamming anyone. Contrary to what most people believe, he did not sell at the top. He sold at three different price points as it rose. One of those price points was around $100. Unfortunately he made a bad decision and announced that he no longer has litecoin when it was at the top. All in all, he's a good guy that sucks at PR and needs a break from litecoin and this community. Once litecoin goes past it's ATH again he said he's going to go into the shadows. I can tell that he feels really bad about what the community thinks of him and because of that he wants to see it through that we will have the opportunity to sell our litecoins at a new ATH."

The rewards are inversely proportional to #eth staked so it should sort itself out. If we don't have enough stakers the rewards are pretty juicy. If we have an overabundance of stakers the rewards are lackluster and some people will stop. On top of that I believe you will be able to simultaneously supply your ethereum as collateral in defi while staking it, if this ends up working then you can get your X% from Maker/Compound while also getting the X% from staking returns. https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/vitalik-upcoming-eth-pos-algorithm-will-adopt-higher-staking-rewards/ At Ethereums current price, if staking was happening, it would be MASSIVELY overvalued.

It's part of its very definition, in how it was conceptualized in written descriptions during launch and beyond. The implemented code running on full nodes constitute what bitcoin is. Changes to such code require consensus; regardless of what roadmap exists or doesn't exist. If a majority of users won't run the changed code, and use those nodes to transact upon, it won't be bitcoin, even if it adheres to some roadmap. Core was entrusted with control over Bitcoin's software distribution channels on the assumption that it would carry out that roadmap. Instead, it betrayed that trust, and changed the roadmap, without consensus. More BCH propaganda, more misdirection with roadmaps. If Core had no consensus, then users would not have used their client to transact upon. If core withheld any important changes that did carry consensus, users would have forked away. A small subset did, and they are now BCH. Nothing about this statement is an \"unsolved mathemetical problem\". Except for SPV wallets being able to detect invalid blocks, which is unsolved. To focus in on one isolated statement, and then interpret it as meaning \"Satoshi was proposing fraud proofs\", and then from there conclude that \"since Satoshi was proposing fraud proofs, and since we don't know how to create them, everything Satoshi proposed is null\". In short, your claim is propaganda/disinformation. This is a completely overblown reaction to my original reaction, where I pointed out an obvious flaw in the whitepaper, and simply noted that Satoshi wasn't infallible. Where did you read me claiming \"everything Satoshi proposed is null\"? Again, Satoshi wasn't infallible, and his discussions about Bitcoin back in 2011 have substantially aged since then. With the lessons we have learned over the course of 8 years, new insights have emerged that favor keeping the blocks small, and using it as a settlement layer on top of which second layer systems can be built."

Your ignorance is showing. One of the key arguments for why TA works is because people think it does, creating a self fulfilling prophecy. Resistance lines and as resistance because people will place orders right above them in hopes of a breakout, therefore you see a sudden increase in orders waiting to be filled right above resistance but not below. Vice versa for support lines. Same thing with trend lines.

And yet I usually keep this thought to myself around crypto fans, because everyone shits on EOS, mostly due to vaguely racist anti-China fearmongering. Suit yourself, everyone’s got their opinion.

Everyone acknowledges this fact, and there's a mountain of documentary evidence this happened. Theymos himself admitted it, in creating a post declaring the new censorship policy against XT. All posts promoting the XT client were removed. Anyone posting about XT, or posting about how XT posts were being removed, was banned. And I've already provided my rationale for why XT would have won: the other two major economic constituents besides users (especially those doing the bulk of the communication in places like /r/Bitcoin): big companies and miners, were overwhelmingly supportive of it. So that means we have very strong indication that all major economic constituents supported a hard fork, and had the momentum not been disrupted by the censorship imposed, it would have almost certainly won out. You keep trying to brush aside the effect that the censorship had, which was to totallu disrupt Bitcoin's organic process of arriving at a social consensus on hard forking, because you don't want to admit that BTC's elite is thoroughly corrupt."

  "reddit": "If you've purchased an item from another player, and a game owner decides they don't like that, they could historically remove it from your character (or ban your character that has the item) and you lose that financial asset. That doesn't happen with NFTs. Why not? Couldn't they just look it up on the blockchain, identify that the asset was transferred from one player to the other, and still ban the player? As long as the game owner controls the servers they can do whatever they want. Sure, they can't remove the NFT associated with the player, but they can disregard it. If the NFT is essentially \"blacklisted\" from the server, for all intents and purposes you've lost the value of the asset since it's useless. All NFTs do is ensure that you \"own\" independently-useless data whose value is entirely determined by the games run by developers. Oh, you've got the legendary \"Miracle Sword\", that's great, everyone knows you have the \"Miracle Sword\" and there's no taking it away from you....oh damn, the developer patched out the Miracle Sword and it's no longer usable in-game.

Also, new side chains can be deployed indefinitely, so Elastos is in theory at least infinitely scalable. Do you remember the cryptokitties dApp that completely broke the Ethereum platform?

Many will fail, the chances you have the next apple/google is very very low. Consider what these new IEO's have done, and how your old \"hot\" coins have fell off, the hype is gone, they're still vaporware, or still struggling for any sort of road maps to be achieved. Or at the very least, there will be a better buying opportunity once BTC dominance lowers."

  "reddit": "VeChain is an evolution of Ethereum with a number of enhancements made after a year or two of experience running a private consortium chain based on a fork of Eth. These enhancements are specifically targeted for ease of adoption, simpler governance, and enhanced performance. Under the hood, it still uses the Ethereum VM for smart contracts, so most solidity smart contracts are directly portable, or need very little work to change. There are a bunch of enhancements for adoption, but the two biggest ones are multi-party payment protocol, and the twin-token system. Multi-Party Payment (MPP) allows for a 3rd party to pay the cost of a transaction. This lets a company set up a blockchain app and sponsor the transactions sent by users of the app, allowing people to interact with the blockchain without knowing about it or dealing with complex crypto concepts. Twin Token System (VET/VTHO) \\- Transactions and smart contract executions are paid in VTHO. VET generates VTHO. This allows the total value of the ecosystem, in VET, to appreciate over time, while transactions costs remain stable. The conversion ratio of VTHO - gas is able to be adjusted to allow for this, so over time the ecosystem can become more and more heavily used, but transaction costs remain largely stable and low. Growth is achieved by increasing number of transactions, not by each individual transaction costing more in fiat. With ETH, as the token becomes more expensive, the usage of the blockchain becomes more expensive, disincentivizing actual usage. Governance involves a tradeoff, with less decentralization in exchange for more rapid development. There are 101 authority nodes that can actually authorize/write new blocks, though they accept transactions from anymore. The smaller number of nodes allows coordination of forks/enhancements to the protocol to be far simpler than with bitcoin or ethereum which have to deal with much larger political battles to make fundamental enhancements to the blockchain. The protocol has already undergone several forks to provide enhancements to the core blockchain code. Performance is also vastly improved with the smaller number of nodes, allowing for mass adoption. Lab results have shown over 10,000 TPS, and community members have checked out the code and ran tests (on really weak hardware) of 3,000 TPS with the current source. VeChain is built as infrastructure for the blockchain revolution, focusing on barriers to real world adoption. While most people think of it as a supply chain token, in actuality it is Ethereum plus a number of enhancements to allow for better adoption in real world scenarios, with a particular emphasis on major enterprise utilization. While the idea of a crypto utopia free from banks promoted by many early bitcoin evangelists is fun, I personally think major real world blockchain adoption will stem from major enterprises using it as part of their technology stack to solve business inefficiencies around trust and ownership of data."

Nano will be encouraged by retail because the difference between 1 second and 5 seconds is massive when there is a long line at the counter. This is a good point, the longer the lines get the more of an issue this will become. We would have to be kidding ourselves to think Ripple isn't trying to increase this transaction time though. I would have to imagine in situations with anything less than 5 seconds in P2P transactions, human movement speed would be a bigger bottleneck than transaction time. Unfortunately I don't have data on that comparison though so that's just me speculating. As for banks/credit card companies, we have to remember that crypto mass adoption is almost certainly going to come first in underdeveloped countries. Places where they hate their shitty fiat, and banking services are sparse and exploitative. It is these people, the ones that really NEED it, that will be using it first. I agree that this is one of the likely paths for adoption, especially for Nano and Ripple. I don't view this as a reliable means or most likely though. In many of these cases you'll be fighting against oppressive governments and even when you're not there is no roadmap or template for this. You're basically waiting for the market to crash enough for this to happen which is entirely outside your control and then hoping they go with Nano. For me personally, I view novel utility pushing corporate adoption through natural market forces as a safer, more likely, and more reliable path but that's just my opinion. And the massive resources and \"head start\" doesn't mean jack squat when you have an inferior product. Look at AOL, or Blockbuster Video, or any of the dozens of Automobile companies that were created before Ford. Simply put, if your product is worse, you are going to loose. Google was far from the first search engine, but it destroyed Yahoo, Excite, Altavista, Lycos and many others that had HUGE resources and a head start. Why? It was better. That is Nano right there. This is just simply not true. History is riddled with examples of better tech crashing and burning against inferior tech. The most popular example is VHS vs Betamax but there are plenty more: Combustion engine, qwerty keyboard, personal rapid transit, direct vs alternating current, etc. Google succeeded because they took what everyone else saw as a feature, search, and made it the product. They took a completely novel approach that ended up being so intuitive it spread like wildfire. So far Nano hasn't shown they've done that but only time will tell if block lattice could be this markets \"search\" Now, I agree that some other crypto, like Ripple, can compete. However, ultimately these people will choose zero fees over even a tiny fee. A fee is a fee. Ripple is NOT free to use, Nano is. You tell me what the poor expat worker is going to choose in that situation. I agree with this in a long term perspective. Once the village idiot can even use crypto, things like zero fees will become very important, but right now it doesn't appear to be a priority differentiator. If it was, Bitcoin wouldn't still be king. In the short term though, I just don't think people have enough general knowledge of crypto yet for this to take root."

The real game changer would be a major clearing bank such as Citigroup or JP Morgan opting to use xRapid. look at SBI, 80% of all of japans wealth/assets are on their books. They are all in on XRP. this is old news shit. try and keep up https://twitter.com/ripple/status/941498342252544001?lang=en or how about the BoA patent which uses Ripples tech? https://cointelegraph.com/news/bank-of-america-files-patent-for-settlement-system-citing-ripple Plus what’s this shitty link of partners you sent lmao. Not even a reputable source more like something made by some kid in his basement. click the source and click each bank. each has a document published by them. Dude I don’t care about xrp I don’t have anything against what they are trying to do but my problem is they kept over half the supply which is bs and what they are trying to achieve won’t ever happen. A war chest to fund adoption and build the roads and highways is a much better buisness strategy than sell to pay for electrical costs and fund no adoption... Miners dont care about increased BTC adoption, they care about better more efficient ASIC and cheaper electrical/upkeep costs to maximize profits."

There are more than 500,000 land records in the Zambian land administration, but only 176,000 of these records are complete. And, with the government issuing an average of just seven thousand land titles a year for the past decade, it’d take the government dozens of years to get its act straight. That all changed when the government started experimenting with registering land titles on blockchain in late 2018. Medici Land Governance, a public benefit corporation who’s partnered with the Zambian government, was able to collect full property records for 56,000 title holders in under three months, smashing the 7,000 a year average. And unlike conventional deeds, new deeds issued via blockchain are tamperproof, meaning they can’t be edited or altered. ... Without the right land title, “you’re more likely to be forcibly evicted, and less likely to be properly compensated. This lack of property documentation and recognition of rights drives violent conflict all around the world. It’s critically important,” Boudreaux tells Decrypt."

There are things like channel factories that will enable many transactions to pile into the same tx for opening and closing second layer channels, and other improvements like Schnorr that will incrementally scale Bitcoin on-chain tx like Segwit. The way we envision Bitcoin at the start, and the way it gets used in 10 more years will be different, and that's OK."

Without looking into it I have absolutely no idea how it works or if a complete collapse of the crypto ecosystem will still allow it to work but if that’s true I could see dash surviving bitcoins demise. As long as people still want to use it after the failure of the grand experiment. I think if decentralized experiment fails we’re going to left with a very centralized version of the same thing. Fiat crypto basically. That’s what scares me to death EDIT: is there a means to go both in and out? Fiat to crypto and crypto to fiat? Granted I think that a one way solution is the holy grail where when you receive a coin you start to become your own Bank and hold it to spend it when you need it but that’s very idealist in the current market environment. Businesses will unfortunately want to settle back out to fiat for the time being as they can’t pay their vendors in crypto"

Rail against alts if you want, but at least use sound reasoning to do it. There's a reason that guy was absolutely rekt in the comments. There are tons of shitty alts. There are also tons of good alts. You make money by investing in projects that go up, which sometimes means alts and sometimes doesn't. You lose money by being like that guy and constantly buying high and selling low, all while blaming your wife for your own stupidity. Idiocy is currency-agnostic."

There may be more individuals working on Open Source projects for fun or passion, but their output doesn’t compare to the people who do it professionally.

Energy has a cost, and if a system is using a large amount of energy then someone has to be paying for it. The fact it's being masked somewhat by gradually increasing price is what's scary, because that price won't increase forever.

As a fintech start up they're currently sitting on panels with international financial leaders, which is far from normal. Ripple is spreading across the world at an astonishing rate. If you have 20 minutes, I'd reccomend this video; https://youtu.be/zXtX9XrGBcc I somewhat agree. I think there will be 2 or 3 that dominate, just like social media platforms. I don't think XRP will remain in the top 3 for long. As soon as a federal court finds that it is a security, the scheme is over. If the fed declares XRP a security, then by those regulations they will also be ruling themselves out of ever being able to produce anything similar, in order to compete in the crypto space.

If not, you can use historical pricing data from either the exchange or coinmarketcap or similar. It is a pain in the ass but there are plenty of ways to automate this if you do a ton of transactions, and even if you do it manually it basically involves making a big excel spreadsheet. The IRS isn't going to take your laziness about doing it as a reason to avoid paying your taxes.

  "reddit": "Hello, Please understand that Phase 1 of our DATA alliance has been released and many exchanges that did submit the required documentation have been excluded. We are still working on the perimeters for Phase 2 and 3. The primary objective of DATA is not to weed out bad actors (even though that would be a positive outcome), but enrich the decision-making process of our users by publishing a wider array of data points. In keeping with the ethos of self-sovereignty, our philosophy is to provide as much information as possible to our users, so that they can form their own conclusions and interpretations. Rather than adopt a more paternalistic/curated approach, we have elected to – through our revised ranking methodology – incentivize (or \"nudge\"') transparent behavior with the belief that it would be more difficult for bad actors to cover their tracks. It is our belief that the willingness of a project to disclose more information is more likely to be correlated with honest intentions and behavior. Conversely, the omission of such information may raise questions about the project’s status and prompt users to dig deeper. While it is possible for exchanges to fake their data, it would be considerably harder to do so with impunity since the chances of being discovered would be magnified. Of course, the push for greater transparency would only be useful insofar as one is willing to perform the requisite due diligence. The challenge is that most of the issues with exchanges can only be discovered after the fact. Consider an example where an exchange has malicious intentions. Even if one were to perform small \"test trades and withdrawals\" on the platform successfully, it could still mask the issue of fractional reserves, which would only become apparent when users attempt to withdraw larger amounts en-masse. Our hope is that the greater availability of information in a transparent manner will help individuals in managing their own risk and doing their own due diligence. Thank you."

 {
  "reddit": "Indeed it has, getting paid to click ads has been around for decades. Unless your trying to nitpick and say that none of the others had their own (kinda but not really) browser. Also you’ll notice that brave does not payout cash. Are you comparing Brave to click farms? lul. Not comparable at all. Brave pay you for allowing a couple small ads that you may not even notice. No, people taking advantage of the system and dumping as much bat as they can get their hands on does not cause the price to go up. There are obviously safeguards in place to prevent abuse. In fact you were the one who brought up \"flooded\" and im just stating a fact that if there are a lot of users there are obviously more advertisers who buy BAT tokens. This removes supply from the market before slowly most of it returns. Overall this creates a upwards pressure on the price. Those advertisers soon realize that the people who click ads for pay aren’t their target audience and stop buying bat. BAT is a long term L, trying to con people to buy your bags is immoral. In fact its highly targeted, especially now to begin with as most users are crypto interested. There are reasons to believe that users are more likely to notice ads that they are paid to see. I notice this myself as im constantly looking for the ads to check that its working. No one gets paid for clicking ads, you should read up on something before you bash it perhaps. Makes you look a tad foolish when you dont even know how the basic components work, yet here you are telling the world how bad they are ;) Or not, they can just keep advertising like they are. If so they will not reach the millions of Brave users.. Does seem like advertisers love Brave, they are signing up in droves. Sure, why do we need a cryptocurrency? You need a crypto to enable micro transactions and cross platform link. With BAT a user can tip a content creator on reddit, twitter and so forth. Sending small payment with FIAT is very expensive, so expensive that it has never been an option. More specifically a centralized crypto? BAT is not centralized, its a decentralized protocol that Brave has implemented. Brave and BAT are to different things. Any project can adopt the BAT protocol and enable whatever BAT functionality they would like. Why do you need BAT? Because it makes sense from many perspectives. Having users send BTC for example would not be viable as the fees would be to expensive. More importantly if you build a protocol such as BAT tailored towards this exact usecase then you end up with a perfect product. Most things in the future will be tokenized, its just a great way to devide things of value. Why not any low fee crypto? Funny you ask because that will be possible in the future. The BAT protocol will simply run behind the scenes and the user may choose himself what unit he/she would like to utilize. Atomic swaps and other tech will make transitioning from/to various crypto very efficient. Seems like a good way for the creators to make some money. You are correct, it allowed them to raise capital and develop Brave. They could have gone for normal VC funding, but they wanted a community involved product as it has many benefits. The creators however have no personal evil scheme going if thats what you are implying. The CEO was one of the founders of Firefox, another browser you may be familiar with. Every crypto says this. What are people supposed to take their $2 monthly earnings and buy chips? I haven't heard that from many projects. Not sure why you are implying that someone will only make 2usd. You can a lot more if your favorite websites and content creators support BAT. If you want you can immediately use those funds, how neat is that. With a card from Monolith you could then buy a few bags of chips basically for free. So? Supply matters much less than demand. And the business model doesn’t allow for long term demand. Well supply and demand both matter, obviously. If demand is high then naturally there will be less supply. The business model (which you have no idea about) definitely allows for extreme long term demand, given that BAT is used by many people. No one is arguing that if many adopt and use BAT it will decrease in value. Neither are you I hope. The fact is, if advertisers start buying BAT for millions of USD to reach the millions of Brave users, then naturally prices will go up."

If you create a majority without building mana first nobody will peer with you. But again, we'll need to wait for testnet to be up to fully test it, so you could be right. But all of this was thought out and is explained in detail."

In fact, unless an asset's price simply goes up forever, it WILL fall off its ATH. You sitting on the sidelines for 18 months kinda stuns me...it's like someone who hates money or something. :) - if you looked at XRP's price history (or almost any crypto for that matter), it's freqently fallen 90% off its last ATH (cluebat #1) and it's never gone to zero in 6 years (so you might have a BIT of a wait on your hands, cluebat #2) Now, I hope you're sitting down for this one, because it will change how you see EVERYTHING about investing - you can actually put in a bigger lot size or increase your leverage if you want to make more money. Now here's the pièce de résistance, putting all of that aforementioned hard-earned knowledge into a gameplan - with shorting, investors can leverage more and have a bigger initial investment when the probability of the asset's price falling is higher. I know, I know. It's a lot to take in. Didn't you ever think in the last 18 months to short XRP? There's cluebat #3.

(except for attacking that chain with your hashpower which has never happened so far) there boss seems to be a completely crazy guy Bitcoin Cash started as the Minimal Viable Fork project to have a version of Bitcoin that is allowed to grow beyond 400 000 tx a day. Many coders, miners and business people all over the space participated. There is no boss. Roger Ver has always been an outspoken fan of crypto ever since 2011 when he became the first business guy to invest in crypto start ups. Sucks that he is no longer a fan of BTC cause he is quite the asset to have because of his excellent connections with basically any crypto project and start up. He was even among the first investors in to Ripple! Although he is the top mod of /r/btc and he was smart enought to buy the bitcoin.com domain (which is a really nice domain to have) he is not the \"boss\" of Bitcoin Cash anymore then Theymos is the boss of Bitcoin. Why would this erratic currency be preferred? Because it still supports instant payments that cost less then a cent. BTC can no longer be used instant unless you lock of BTC in LN channels which is such a hassle compared to just directly using BTC that if people are hardly using crypto as money you already know that when you make something as complicated as LN that if will be even harder to find people that want to use it.

Similar with the other use cases you mentioned. If we really want to test our utility, we should set up actual experiments. Of course, only people who already support nano would support this idea, as it’s already known which is the better use case for transactions - particularly micro transactions."

  "reddit": "It is, you can't make data flows disappear and expect the same result, that's just not logical. In bitcoin is means the requirement of having every node confirm every transaction, you can try to do this with a DAG but will end up with the same amount of data. So the difference here is that other projects try to make the dataflow distributed as well, e.a why do I need to confirm the whole world when I just need what's important to me? It's the same subjective difference BTC and its forks have. In ETH is will be data distribution through shards instead of the whole ledger, in IOTA this means data per individual. If it can be decentralized and secure what gives right? Sadly this isn't how others see it. For what's it's worth, I prefer the latter approach. I don't see much in needing the whole world on each individual account, hence I started mainly looking past BTC since 2015. But the notion of newer (actually some of these DAG's are actually older tech) data structures solving anything in a \"objective\" way is a false one, that's not how DLT's work. (Edit: well besides optimizations that is, those can definitely be objective) I'm definitely more excited about stuff like Nano, Hashgraph and Iota or even stuff like MimbleWimble as a bitcoin side chain or LN to change the data approach, but currently we still live in a subjective industry and it's important to keep that in mind since that will definitely impact your investment decisions and the market will have no chill to fuck you over."

  "reddit": "The evidence from before the censorship of /r/Bitcoin began shows that the majority who were exposed to the arguments supported the big blocks, given pro-hard-fork posts dominated the subreddit's front-page. But then the forum was censored, so 1. all Bitcoiners couldn't have get involved in that discussion and make an informed decision on the matter, and 2. many of those who supported the original large-block scaling plan couldn't coordinate on a common forum to do a simultaneous jump to the new fork to make it successful. Hard forks are very hard to coordinate because they require a majority of the userbase/economy to simulanteously switch to the new chain. Censorship of a key forum used by stakeholders to communicate being censored makes conducting a successful hard fork an uphill battle, no matter how justified and sensible the proposed hard fork is. You're arguing that since the majority chose not to jump to the large-block fork, that means the original scaling plan wouldn't have won out if there had been no censorship, which is totally baseless."

So you can lock up an amount of Ether and as long as the value doesn't drop below 150% collateralisation (so for simplicity say Ether was $150 you could draw a max of 100 Dai but if the value of Ether then dropped you would be 'liquidated') then you will accrue interest as per the stability fee %. You are free to do whatever you like with the Dai, and you can at any point pay back as little or as much as you like. If you pay back the full amount + interest you can close your position. Just for info, liquidation means that your collateral is sold off at market to pay back your CDP, a 13% is taken and any remaining ether is returned to you. As you said that is one advantage that you can essentially use it as a permissionless way to open a low leverage long on Ether. For example when we were in the depths of the bear market and the stability fee was really low, people were opening CDPs and drawing Dai to then buy more ether with. If they bought one ether that way for $100 with borrowed Dai and then when it ballooned sold that same ether for say $200, they can close their CDP for $100+stability fee and are left with the remainder from their sale! All the while they never actually sold their Ether at market lows."

There has never been as much discord and divide as there is now, which means they have their hands deeper than ever in your pocket. I don’t disagree with taxes. But I’m aware a large portion goes towards funding absurd pensions that should have never been promised in the first place. The debt always gets passed on to someone else..."

  "reddit": "Gold, silver and copper coins worked perfectly well for millennia. Did they? When a gold coin has an imprinted value (gold coin as money, e.g. ) ), it's value is based on two things: It's intrinsic value based on the gold price and the imprinted value. It's easy to see what happens next. When the gold price drops below the denomination, people will use the coin as money. If the gold price rises above it, people start melting the coins and sell the gold. Same has happened for copper coins. Ancient gold \"coins\" as you described it were in fact traded as little pieces of gold and no one cared about the imprint. But that's not \"money\", that's commodity trade. Bitcoin is virtual/digital, it can only be money, it cannot be a commodity. But to say a currency shouldn't have intrinsic value is absurd. All modern money has no intrinsic value! Neither the Dollar, nor the Euro, etc. It amazes me how you were fooled that it was different."

Then you need to trust those devs aren't screwing you over, or that your entity doesn't become corrupt (\"this blockchain rocks!\" Gets paid $500k by the blockchain devs who've installed a backdoor. Then on top of all that, most blockchains are junk, pointless, and just serve no purpose. It's like creating a non-profit to make sure that every deodorant has the ingredients it claims to have....

They might simply be pitchmen employed to extol the wonders of legitimate products. But in the early 1900s, when the first uses of the verb shill were documented, it was more likely that anyone hired to shill you was trying to con you into parting with some cash. Practitioners were called shills (that noun also dates from the early 1900s), and they did everything from faking big wins at casinos (to promote gambling) to pretending to buy tickets (to encourage people to see certain shows). Shill is thought to be a shortened form of shillaber, but etymologists have found no definitive evidence of where that longer term originated. Oxford dictionary also gives this definition for a shill: A person who pretends to give an impartial endorsement of something in which they themselves have an interest. For how the definition is used on the street, the top answer of Urban Dictionary has your back: A person engaged in covert advertising. The shill attempts to spread buzz by personally endorsing the product in public forums with the pretense of sincerity, when in fact he is being paid for his services. We already have a word for \"spokesman or promoter\". You can use spokesman, or promoter. A shill has an invested interest while trying to convince the world they're impartial. Don't dilute the meaning of words."

At first it is slow, but eventually the difficulty will decrease, and then the one coalition will control all pos and pow blocks, and blocks will be happening at the normal speed. Not to mention you could easily disallow that by consensus causing anyone that does try to censor PoW in some way to fork off. So you want to punish censorship. The ability to punish censorship is exactly the property that makes a blockchain vulnerable to the attack I described in my paper. The fact that you can punish censorship to enforce rules means that any coalition that took control of your consensus mechanism would also be able to punish censorship to enforce rules."

The transactions with the first sufficiently weighted votes wins. ORV: A consensus mechanism unique to Nano which involves accounts delegating their balance as voting weight to Representatives. The Representatives vote themselves on the validity of transactions published to the network using the voting weight delegated to them. These votes are shared with their directly connected peers and they also rebroadcast votes seen from Principal Representatives. Votes are tallied and once quorum is reached on a published block, it is considered confirmed by the network. Nano's version of DPoS is significantly different from other DPoS implementations, which is why Nano's consensus mechanism was rebranded to Open Representative Voting (ORV). In Nano, no fees are earned, meaning that there is no incentive for emergent centralization over time from profit maximization and economies of scale. Also, no funds are ever locked up or staked, and voting weight can be remotely re-delegated to anyone at any time. Anyone can be a representative or a principal representative. Nano representatives do not choose transaction order, and they cannot censor transactions. They simply rebroadcast valid blocks that they see. There is no reason to amass massive representative stake in Nano unless you're trying to attack the network. https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/ https://docs.nano.org/glossary/#open-representative-voting-orv"

I don't know where you heard this \"narrative\" but it's not true. NEO is creating a Smart Economy, but it isn't about China. They are a global project working on a global network to power the economy of tomorrow. Just because the founders are originally from China doesn't mean that it's a China shitcoin, it that were the case, why is there developer groups all over the world supporting and building on NEO? Furthermore, NEO paid back all ICO investors. 2. Yes, the founders of NEO are also some of the founders of Ontology. NEO has become more community driven while Ontology is the brainchild of Onchain. NEO and Ontology are separate projects. Nobody left NEO for Ontology, Da Hongfei has confirmed this numerous times. Also, Ontology didn't have an ICO and was an airdrop for NEO holders and Ontology newsletter subscribers. 3. Yes, 7 nodes do control the entire network. That was a design decision from the very beginning to allow for easy testing and upgrading of the core protocol. The NEO Foundation currently runs 5/7 nodes with the other 2 being run by the City of Zion and KPN respectively. As pointed out in the July Monthly report released a few days ago, \"Worked on designing the NEO3 voting mechanism and the corresponding incentive mechanism, choosing the preferred algorithm and technical architecture - 50% complete.\" This is progress towards voting in new consensus nodes that will allow for full decentralization. Note: Testnet is now fully decentralized. Source: 4. Yes, the network did experience some issues with spam transactions. This was a known issue for a while and was finally fixed with the deployment of dBFT 2.0 on the mainnet. Source: 5. \\+6+7. Yes, NEO 3.0 will have a new genesis block but much of what will happen is still being developed and figured out. Not sure where you heard that projects would need to migrate their own data but as far as I know this hasn't fully been fleshed out yet. I'm not going to speculate until I hear what the actual solution will be. 6. See above 7. See above 8. As far as the comment on developers, make no mistake, NEO absolutely has the most global developers of any project after Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Stack Exchange closing down doesn't really mean much, although I'd love to see it start back up again."

That way those who are part of the community using bitcoin to buy coffee daily or whatever didn't have to put $50 bounty on their transaction to push it through the network when it was its worst... To them, BCH is Bitcoin. While BTC has become some weird lightning coin with fees way too high for common use like they originally intended and currently use it for.. What would you have expected to happen? BCH isn't supposed to be different, it's supposed to be what everyone's original Bitcoin was, from before the segwit update, and with increased block size to keep fees low enough for it to be as functional as cash. It was never supposed to be some new crazy crypto like the direction BTC/lightning coin is currently going. It was supposed to be bitcoin to the early crowd who were sold on that original aspect of it... not the new roadmap for BTC where a number of early ideals are being abandoned Apparently continuing with the original plan to prevent fee market of bounties makes it a scam though Forking away was always the go-to fail-safe final defense against any number of unforeseeable possible scenarios such as a corporation or government successfully corrupting a portion of the team of maintainers and starts introducing changes to the protocol that haven't been vetted or accepted by the community... the result should always be a fork You could argue that the \"true\" bitcoin was chosen through consensus and that should be the end of it as that's the purpose of the consensus vote But why would you think consensus is ironclad when simply not touching your node can represent a vote for the other side? Many nodes are asleep at the wheel. So, forking from even a legitimate successful attack on the Bitcoin protocol isn't likely to even ever lead to a successful consensus defense... The only way to spot it is if you're paying close enough attention and even then, what fool would declare knowing everything for certain? The deeper you dig the more obvious it seems there's hardly a pure Bitcoin out there at all right now Regardless... Why waste time helping hostile actors by attacking forks even if it's not your favorite Bitcoin. Is there even a decent reason aside from greed?"

An example of this is when wines are offered to investors at excessively high prices by a company who then go into planned liquidation. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^ ^v0.28"

Because of Bitcoin's decentralized nature, people have created SegWitt and LN and still cant get a sound second layer. Interledger protocol is design to work with ANY token you can name. Just like TCP/IP can connect you to any network. Ripple is using ILP, there is already proof of Bitcoin and Ethereum being transfered instantly inside ILP. The scalability solution you are all waiting for. Ripple is working to communicate Corporations, Banks/FI's and Public Digital Assets like Bitcoin and Altcoins.

Check for yourself: https://i.imgur.com/QLIxJqy.jpg (src: https://nanocharts.info). Now compare that to Bitcoin mining pools: https://www.blockchain.com/en/pools Decentralized. At the time of writing it would require the collusion of three unrelated parties (whom all have a verifiable interest in the currency’s value), to attack the network. Game theory asserts that these actors will not behave in a way contrary to their interests. https://www.kappture.co.uk/files/accepting-cryptocurrency-at-the-point-of-sale.pdf --- Furthermore, Nano users can remotely redelegate their voting weight to anyone at any time, which is a huge advantage over Bitcoin. Users have direct control over network centralization, unlike Bitcoin where miners have control (and whose interests don't always align with normal users). Finally, since there are no earned fees in Nano, there is no incentive for emergent centralization, and we've actually seen this in practice with how Nano's centralization has drastically decreased over time. In Bitcoin, profit maximization and economies of scale cause the opposite effect, incentivizing centralization over time. --- As for first layer scalability, remember that even just 50 TPS (which Nano can comfortably do on low end hardware) is 4,320,000 transactions per day. That's more than enough for the foreseeable future. We've seen prod Nano stress tests at 300+ peak TPS already. - and is capped at 600k - - with - Visa does 2000 TPS, and it's a global payment network used by millions List of stress tests: https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/bxl0hi/does_nano_have_a_plan_so_that_confirmations_keep/eq8f9c1/"

You can't look at the current energy consumption levels and say \"But if it became the new de facto payment system...\", because there's no indications it ever will.

I look at places like Africa, India, etc. Billions of people who are all going to want cars in the coming decades but dirt poor with failing currencies. Bitcoin will actually allow them to compete and purchase modern appliances and vehicles which will actually help to solve the environmental issues, especially if we move more towards renewable energy throughout the world, if we become 100% renewable then it doesn't matter how much electricity bitcoin consumes but if we don't have a sound way to pay for expensive new cars and solutions then we'll still be polluting.

In Kleiman, here we have someone who: • Was highly proficient in C++, also Satoshi’s odd choice for Bitcoin’s source code • Involved on MetzDowd crypto email before and during Satoshi being active on the same service. I recall reading that the Bitcoin whitepaper was originally published one post before one of Kleiman’s. • Fits the USA time zone criteria previously discovered about Satoshi. • Was an intensely private computer genius obsessed with encryption security: also known for super-encrypting everything inc manually inserting memorised 40-digit long keys. He kept a steel USB with him at all times and friends said he even coded from his hospital bed. • His activity and then inactivity through being hospitalised and then dying do match the time of Satoshi’s chats, involvement and disappearance. • Friends speak of his Bitcoin involvement, as does CSW, who is acknowledged in Kleiman’s 2009 book. • After died, his 90 year old father publicly enquired about Bitcoin on a forum. This is odd don’t you think? • CSW publicly freaked out when he learned Kleiman died. He also got in touch with Kleiman’s brother telling him of Kleiman’s involvement. Why would anyone do this? Sounds like only someone with foreknowledge that DK had mega amounts of Bitcoin would do this. And what would CSW gain by letting them know about the 1 million BTC, at least 300k of which CSW knew he’d had to give them as a result of the alleged Trust agreement? It’s very possible Kleiman was Satoshi, was involved with Hal Finney and CSW and the keys died with him."

Angry, intruding in other people’s lives to enforce our opinions, bitter and for some reason, offended by other people having differing views and happy to provoke others from a position of self proclaimed self righteousness. What an incredible society that would be. Thing is, I’m not a deluded optimist. It’s just one thing I’m extremely positive about. It must be difficult for you to acknowledge nuance with your grossly oversimplified views on everything. But that’s fine, because also accept the nuances of humanity. Not everyone will see things my way. That sub grows every single day by 30-50 people, and yet in this thread it’s just the same bunch of people chanting the same tired old mantra, same soundbites, same, refutable lines from years gone by. No one is so persistent without incentive. You’re a FUD group, admit it. You even commented on Vetishist’s post, you couldn’t make it more obvious. You all comment and reply to each other. One dude even just has a few accounts all replying to each other. All in crypto subs, all among the same pocket of accounts. So obvious people are playing games. Honestly, it’s just weird to watch. It’s not even well done. I hope you find peace, Heavy. No man should be living every day with such toxicity and anger in their mind. It isn’t healthy. Stop visiting crypto subs, get to the gym, start gaming, get a hobby, do something you’ll be proud of instead of spreading lies about a company on the internet. That’s literally the world’s worst hobby right there."

ETFs are not inherently cheaper than mutual funds; it depends on the manager strategy. Thankfully fees are being pushed lower for both of them, especially for passive strategies. That said, always read the fine print to ensure you know all the costs of a product before you buy it."

People have accepted the payment, it didn't fail, but that doesn't mean we have a functional, workable, adoptable system ready. If you mean, it's not user friendly for normies, I agree. But even Nano mobile is going to confuse normies....well because they're normies and not used to crypto. Let's be real here - I love Crypto and have my hands deep, but LN is still super user unfriendly and I can't see it being anything else for quite a while. Not sure why we're mentioning Nano (Which has its own deep seated problems) - But my overarching point was that Bitcoin/Crypto in general is still in incubation mode and is nowhere near mainstream. Paying p2p with xmr.to or sending my buddies Groestlcoin doesn't mean those respective networks are rocking and ready for the public. Just means nerds like us can transact a couple times a year on them. Wait, why on earth is this downvoted? Is there people paying with LN here on a daily basis? Hello?"

  "reddit": "Uhhh, No. First off, VET 24hr. volume on Binance: $0.836M. VET 24hr. volume on OceanEx: $4.1M. What is OceanEx? An exchange created by VeChain, ran on VeChain BlockChain. Scammy? Uhhhm, let's ask DNV GL, a globally operating company that provides audit and certification services confirming that an organization meets certain requirements. This is a company with revenue of $2.4B. DNVGL partnered with VeChain, in Jan. 2018. That's right. DNVGL is USING VeChain. DNV GL is also providing VeChain’s blockchain powered services to their huge customer base. Then VET also has PwC, another global leader, who provides it's auditing services to 400+ companies out of the Fortune 500 companies. They've been partnered since May 2017. IBM, Ford, Dell, Cisco and 3M are some of its largest clients and they have been recommending VeChain to them for improved product verification and traceability. That right there alone is 2 worldwide companies that are in business to help other worldwide businesses grow. Not enough? Okay. \\#3 partnership: NRCC, a top-tiered management company offering IT consulting services to developing companies and organizations who are actively seeking to meet International standards of approval. Yet another partnership with a company who is recommending VeChain to businesses that are working to go global. Partnered since May 2017. \\#4. Yida China Holdings Limited, one of China's biggest real estate developers. They develop Industrial Parks and Smart Cities. And what blockchain are these Industrial Parks and Smart Cities going to be using? Vechain :) Partnered since Feb 2018. Those four are just strategic partnerships, meaning, partnerships with companies that are spreading the adoption of VeChain to other companies. Let's have a look at some other partnerships: 5. Central Chinese Government. That's right. Not just a company, but a huge chunk of the world. Partnered since Dec 2017. 6. D.I.G., an Importer that supplies 30% of ALL of the wine in China. Partnered since July 2017. 7. China Unicorn, the world's 4th largest mobile phone service provider. 8. Kuehne and Nagel, who accounts for 15% of the world's air and sea freight business. Revenue: $22.4B. Partnered since Sept 2018. 9. DB Schenker. Worldwide Transport and Logistics company. Revenue $22.8B. Using VeChain to evaluate their suppliers. 10. VET is currently working towards onboarding BMW, and with all of the other partnerships and with having PwC working towards it as well, VeChain will most likely secure BMW as a partner. 11. LVMH, Louis Vuitton. Revenue: $48.6B. 12. Groupe Renault, Revenue: $67B. Partnered July 2017. 13. PICC People's Insurance Company of China, Revenue: $126B This is literally HALF of the partnerships to date (I quit because the post is getting too long.) Anyhow, it is clearly evident that VeChain isn't even close to a scam. It is arguably the most developed, most adopted and most price-suppressed crypto on the market. Soooo, why does price keep going down? Because these big companies aren't going to just throw money away. They got big through the use of good business practices. They are going to suppress the price until they've gotten all of the VET that they need. The only thing is that there are now so many partners and so many partners to come, that price suppression can't last much longer... The obtainment of VET is going to turn into a bidding war between BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANIES and it is set to happen any day now! And if you are curious as to how high VET may go in as little as a year, just take a look at XRP. It was trading in the range of $0.006, and went to an ATH of $3.80. Price suppression of the VET token simply can't last much longer, the real-world demand for it is growing far too great... And when suppression is removed, so are the bounds for the height of the price!"

I feel how ever-globalizing commerce and the world in general are trending, a radical digital solution seems like the logical next step. Everyone in this space is competing to find that winner, whether it be just one, or a number (fast payment, private payment, store of value, enterprise tokens, etc.), and even if it wins, no promise the price appreciates or goes parabolic again, cuz after all a payment currency that’s super volatile is dangerous for consumer and merchants."

Supports that generally aren't broken in a bull market and the fact major institutions are about the open their doors. Don't forget, many indicators confirmed bull cycle after 6k and you usually don't go up 400% if the bear cycle was still on. It's more likely we already entered into the next bullish cycle. Bull cycles don't generally correct much more than 35%. Our 2 month consolidation after hitting 14k was most likely already the punishment for moving up so fast, but people let their fear get ahead of them. Again, speaking most probable outcomes from everything Bitcoin has ever showed us, but anything is possible. Considering the next major EMA, we really shouldn't fall below 7k if we do break down. I sold 20% of my holdings between 12k to high 13k. I was comfortable buying back most near 9k and some near 10k. I will wait for a major move before buying my last 20% I still have in stable. That means above 12.3 or below 9.2k. However, if I already didn't buy back my majority, I'd be consolidating right now and leaving some to cost average. Always, do your own research and do not take my actions as advice. Just because I've been in this some time, doesn't mean BTC can't make me it's bitch.

Yang’s a smart guy but anyone who backs e only, with no paper backup, doesn’t know what they’re talking about and should leave these decisions to IT security professionals. Elections not including paper are illegitimate. End of story. Any blockchain solution should, at best, be the infra underlying voting machines, that ALWAYS print a paper ballot, for confirmation BEFORE the transaction is submitted, to be separately counted and re-counted as validation / verification of the e-vote. Paper should be the source of truth for at least this century; possibly forever. Do not trust anyone who tells you otherwise."

We already have a number of nodes from businesses that are incentivized to do so (Binance, Wirex, Kucoin, Kappture, BrainBlocks, etc). Just like Bitcoin full nodes. Whales and businesses that benefit from Nano (e.g. exchanges, merchant payments, etc) will run nodes to protect their investment and secure the network. The cost of consensus in Nano is so low that the benefits of the network itself are all the incentive you need. Similar to TCP/IP, email servers, and http servers.

  "reddit": "bitcoin reconstructs what money is, or rather how money is. That’s beyond an industry, the entirety of human civilization is built on our social relationships and our commerce and trade. Everything that involves money, will be affected. There are also other effects which fundamentally affect civilization such as making honesty during transactions almost a requirement due to immutability and open nature of data for chains, For example, normally only 25-50% of a population votes for in its democratic election. This leads to a lot of manipulation and minority groups getting hold of government powers (see USA republicans. The wars, laws they have enabled in last 40 years have severely negatively affected the planet. From war promotion to climate change denial, stifling green energy, etc). As voting on chain becomes finely processed , all elections in countries could more reflect the populations intentions, as voting is going to sky rocket to normally between 70%, 80, 90-99%. This changes society at its core, better governments will form that will more normally reflect the “common man’s interest”. Democracy is significantly improved and it’s going to be directly attributed to blockchains nature. There are so many other effects, legitimizing micro economies, financing being accessible by any individual on earth, Esports and gaming being a profitable economy and possible revenue for anyone. Not selling games and items, but player vs player competition with trusted bets. Poverty is going to mean something so different, and essentially be reduced to a fraction of the current people, investments as an entire class will change. Humans can now safely transport wealth across generations, this may not be too obvious to you but about 2/3 of the world have no efficient mechanism to save wealth for their kids For example, if a 3rd world country has 40% inflation rate, by time someone saves $10 over 5 years its back to being worth .77c. This as a system, systematically keeps billions of people in poverty. You can buy $3 worth of btc, and in 5 years it might be worth $30-40 for your kid. The difference between .77c and $40 is significant, especially if whole communities/families start to work together, which is how many poverty stricken cultures are. This is so enormous. There’s a multitude of superb and out right revolutionary changes that crypto brings. For example immigration is one of the biggest problems in the globe. Do you know how much a decentralized secure government identification would change the entire world? Immigration is a priority issue currently in the globe. It’s beyond a “ company” what crypto will do. I can go on and on."

You could end up generating a receive address, sending to it, and then be unable to unlock the wallet to make an outgoing transaction.

The goal of BCH is to onboard the world and facilitate micro coffee transactions. Those two goals are not competing against each othe Like the former lead developer of Bitcoin said: https://twitter.com/gavinandresen/status/929377620000681984?lang=en Bitcoin Cash is what I started working on in 2010: a store of value AND means of exchange. And copy-pasting this point I made a few days ago: Before the narrative shift and the censorship regime imposed on /r/Bitcoin in 2015, BTC was seeing tx volumes more than double every year. The bull markets before 2015, in 2011 and 2013, were also proportionally much larger than anything that came after. Bitcoin's market dominance was also around 90% before the narrative shift, and since the shift, has dropped to as low as 30%, and is now at 69%, and only because as the largest-cap cryptocurrency, it bore the downturn better than other crypto-assets. So by all indications, it was on a better trajectory when the point was to put BTC on every person's mobile phone, and make it usable as a currency in any situation, rather than when it became a high-fee payment system which cannot practically be held by ordinary people on their own devices, and must instead be stored on a centralized exchange, and used solely as a speculative instrument that people trade IOUs of."

Sure, and people have to pay higher fees because of that. Every individual is free to set his own fee based on his tx priority. Absolutely, and setting the rewards too low will cause their transactions to take longer, or get stuck. How would a person reasonably conduct business when transaction take hours? No you don't. Every individual makes that decision for himself. And you need many individuals to make the decision too. You need to be able to make most of your transaction with bitcoin, or have a local market liquid enough for larger sales. But 5 TPS makes this impossible. Let them try. Governments can't even figure out how to ban physical items, let alone digital ones. Prohibition is a useless tactic and it won't stop determined individuals. They can outlaw it and add heavy fines. Businesses won't accept it. Banks will freeze accounts and funds associated with it. Large scale miners would be identified by their power usage and shut down. On off ramps would be shut down, starving miners of real money they need to cover operating costs. It can be effectively banned."

At the end of the day all other coins are standing on the shoulders of giants (BTC) EDIT: It's also an extremely common noobtrap to 'not invest in the highest marketcap coins' Think about it for stocks as well, Amazon, Microsoft, all have the highest market caps yet they're still beating the markets in terms of annual return. There's a good reason a certain player is on top. BTC has a ton of room to grow still, while other coins we still argue over whether they really have a fundamental value at all. In my opinion, it is very realistic BTC will capture something like 40% of the gold market (being an 8 trillion dollar market) That would price BTC around \\160k.

CT/MW development will come in time. We get most of our developments from Bitcoin. And that’s perfectly fine. Litecoin works today. If we have 0 improvements from now on, it doesn’t diminish the fact that Litecoin works very well as money. I personally think adoption is much more important than core protocol devlopment today. We need more people to know about LTC. We need better and easier to use wallets. We need more merchants accepting LTC. So things like Spedn supporting LTC, partnerships with Dolphins, work on LoafWallet and new lightning wallets is more important than adding fungibility to Litecoin. Yes, fungibility is important as I’ve said in my tweets. But that’s a long term goal. People want an update today because they care about pumping the price. I don’t care about that. From that chat, seems clever. People asking to implement things continuously and on a rush don't realise this is a network moving billions of dollars every day. You have to be careful when you alter the protocol. Adoption and public exposure seem to be his goals and he's doing it well. On the flip side, it's true that finding the right devs for CT/MW is fucking hard, this is not a job for the typical mediocre developer, must get a top class coder And more importantly (not from Coblee but another member of the foundation) Due to open source nature, you cant gain competitive advantage from innovation You can get competitive advantage from branding and adoption I've been in many startups and companies and I'm in tears reading that, they get it, they have the right mindset to move a project forward.

  "reddit": "This move really disappoints me, I've worked for months/years trying to improve the relationship between PIVX and her forks, and this type of article and behaviour really sets us all back. Firstly, while I'm listed as a team member, I am an outlier and NOT a developer, so do not take my comments as being representative of the 'PIVX TEAM' of which anyone can join, its not a crypto company, but an old school, non-ico, crypto project. I read the article and honestly it smacked of sensationalism, finger pointing and grandstanding. However, the addresses listed are exhibiting strange behaviour, but not to the extent that the article writer would have everyone believe. The fact that the author went public to expose a possible frailty in not only PIVX but ALL of her forks (by the authors claims) because they didn't receive a response from core devs over the weekend shows the authors obvious disregard for ALL other PoS projects. The ethical thing to do would be to allow some time for this to reach people like myself and others who have a enough knowledge to compile these concerns into a format that devs can understand, the first I heard of this was from reading the article. Now I really don't want to deflect from the issue by replying purely to how the article was written, so I will address Furszy's response and what I PERSONALLY understand about the possible issue. You only have to go back a week or so to see a discussion I had with Furszy, that shows, this is just how the guy communicates. There is very little love lost between myself and furszy, that much is common knowledge, but to suggest that him or any other core developer is deliberately exploiting the chain that they work tirelessly on securing, so that they can exploit what equates to a few thousand dollars, when they are paid more than that, is stupid and possibly libel. Furszy is not known for his skills in communication, its for his skills in coding that he is valued, and despite how much I dislike how he speaks to people, it does not change the facts of what he said being true. PIVX Devs do not work for Bitgreen or for PIVX forks, expecting a full and documented response to a question within 36hrs is unfair. This is open source, not free labour. Team Lunar should not have been banned from the Discord, I will ask for them to be re-instated, I have on MANY occasion explained that I feel banning should not be the first action, and I have had a public voice discussion surrounding this possible exploit, I think this was after they had been banned, but I had no part in that and would like them to be re-instated, hopefully they \\[team lunar\\] can start to behave in a little more civil and less accusational way. From my limited understanding the Bitgreen fix is simply to raise the amount of coins needed to stake, which is not such a simple fix for PIVX, changing consensus rules so readily is a little gung-ho and I cannot possibly see a world where PIVX within 36hrs applies a fix to a previously undiscovered issue by copying the code of a tiny project like Bitgreen which has only had a few minor updates in its entire history. Time would be needed to verify the code and consider how the new code interacts with the existing code, this will need to be done by a number of PIVX devs and will certainly take a lot longer than the knee-jerk fix applied by Bitgreen. This should be conveyed in the article, instead the writer attempts to imply that other respectable projects should just copy and implement code in a paniced fashion without any due diligence. I regularly invite developers from PIVX forks to a discord channel for C++ developers that I'm an admin in, if Bitgreen had contacted me I'd certainly of raised the issue there, infact I think it's been actively discussed and more facts are quickly coming to light, The final point 6. that PIVX devs let this go on for god knows how long, is utter trash. This is NOT fake stake reinvented, this has 0 to do with Fake stake, this is seemingly something totally different that has been going on judging by block explorers, by 1 actor for a matter of days. I invite the author to contact me personally if he really has interest in solving this and its not an attention grab before moving to PoW. And FAR more importantly I invite all the other forks who may be less dev heavy to also contact me if they need reassurances or want to be kept in the loop as much as I can. Remember I am NOT a PIVX dev, Im barely a team member, but working with other devs from PIVX forks we have quite a few good minds ready to look into this. Thanks for reading, apologies for my bad grammar and spelling, I've just rushed this out in response to a call from the Zenzo guys in our discord and I hope people find value and a little perspective in my words. Overall lets try to work together and not launch these sorts of attacks, I'm glad that yet another issue has probably been uncovered, but I'm saddened at the methods used to draw attention to the situation. PS. disabling Bitgreens masternodes probably made Bitgreens situation worse as it would increase the area the attacker was exploiting, but assuming this was Fake stake was your first mistake. PEACE."

And then Charlie dumping his coins, which he mined \"fairly\" like everyone else. And then there's Ripple. Took till 2018 to finally have a minority control over the network. For years 1 company in control, for years staying closed source. Has printed a whopping 20% of the supply for the founders and 60% for 1 single company which they are still dumping each month. One founder even ordered by court not to be able to dump as much (and founding another coin with an even worse supply). You're asking people to celebrate Ripple's victory's, but understand how deep-rooted some people hate it. No matter what they will do, whether it be good for the whole space, it will always get hate because of its history."

So when you buy from Bitmain they will negotiate a price and time and then they deliver \\exactly\\ on time. Innsillicon, well, sometimes they do or you know it is Chinese New Year or it was raining or the sky was cloudy or a friend's friend had a medical emergency or here just take this book of excuses why we can't deliver on time. Bitmain will sell you one unit if you want- who does that? So sure, I get the animosity to Bitmain because they acted exactly like a rational actor would and tried to massively profit from the Bitcoin fork with BCH. They paid for that by bag holding a million BCH and today is there any real argument which one is the real Bitcoin as the market decides it? BTC has more nodes, more hash rate, more developers, literally everything. So Bitmain lost their gamble. Still, they understand manufacturing and they execute like few I have ever seen. It is easy to talk about but hard to actually do. Not that long ago they were nothing and from nothing they are now a manufacturing powerhouse with unbelievable operational control. That doesn't mean anyone has to like them, that is not a comment on their philosophy, just purely from a manufacturing operation I would never bet against them."

That's why you'll have seen me here many times attempting to educate Binance holders about how they can improve Nano's security by withdrawing their funds to a Natrium.io or NanoVault.io wallet. Also why would they be sued? There’s no laws against paying for votes in Nano. Not to mention if there were then you are not relying on Nano’s consensus mechanism but governments to keep the network honest. For breach of a duty of care by those holding Nano on Binance. state: 4.

Yet for me, it shines above all other options when it comes to what matters in being a cryptocurrency. This is speaking about the tech, and generally not the perceived market value and ROI. I won't claim to speak for whatever other upcoming coins there are out there, but show me one that's an even bigger winner, and I'll be the first to jump into that. As for LN, I have my daily dose of maximalist content on twitter. After following pretty much every major LN evangelist for years, I'd tell anyone right now not to bother holding their breath.

It's like reporting on what some raving lunatic on the street said about Ethereum. for not supporting a scaling road map that neither had user consensus nor make any sense in the long term? It was the original scaling roadmap! You need consensus to change it, not vice versa! And it made perfect sense. Satoshi himself said so: Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. His points are even more valid today than they were in late 2008."

A cool off makes sense since BTC has been growing much faster since its December 2018 low than it had recovered in 2015. If this happens, I call an alt season. There hasn't been one so far because BTC didn't take a break. At 70% dominance, it might finally be time. If it only went down by a seventh to 60%, altcoin dominance would go up by a third from 30% to 40%. That's an average 33% spike in prices. There is lots of room to the upside for alts. Not so much to the downside since there ain't many sellers left. Can't remember reading anyone in this sub giving up lately. It's mostly holders left who keep accumulating. And the whales have left us long ago. Like the traders who jumped onto the BTC run and will contribute to an alt season when BTC looses steam."

While it can technically be used for a large number of electronics-related and jewelry related products most people seem to opt for gold as a store of value because they have an ever waning faith in fiat (unbacked by assets) money, government monetary policy based on corruption, and a stock market that has yet to truly retrace the past 7 years. I'm not thinking about gold because you can bend it, that's silly. Bitcoin has zero utility If Bitcoin has zero utility so does gold (per the above). If you were 50% BTC and 50% precious metals, and you're an Argentinian citizen, you're making out pretty good today since these offerings don't correlate to their stock market crash of 48%. Argentinians have a long way to go as it is now being estimated their Peso will likely lose 99% of it's value over the next 1-2 years. Part of the utility in precious metals and BTC is as a way of preserving your wealth. If you choose to not use these instruments that's on you. The other value of Bitcoin, which gold absolutely does not feature, is that every single given transaction is verified by 10,000 - 100,000 individual computers around the world. This is known as decentralization. Bitcoin is open source (self auditing) and does not involve the errors of humans. With a shit $250 PC you can run a node and verify the entire blockchain yourself. Automation of finance legacy financial sector. Auditable digitalization of assets Paying guards to protect/transport gold. Uncensorable/unstoppable cash movement Begging Mr. Banker for a $40 wire transfer. There isn't a reason to not digitalize/automate all stocks, ownership, financial policy. I don't trust humans. I don't want to rely on humans. I recognize you don't care all that much about the scarce argument but just for fun: BTC has a strict limit of 21 Mil. Gold is an ever increasing supply, usually 1.5-2.5% per year. It's not known how technological advances may effect this supply via deep sea extraction. There could be a whole hell of a lot more gold that becomes accessible in the future. BTC, meanwhile, is decreasing in total supply because humans lose their own belongings sometimes. If we can infinitely fork it Ok, infinitely fork it. Lets see how many people make the switch. This is known as the network effect."

  "reddit": "Except you don’t have to pay $5 to get your payout. You can pay pennies and most of the time get it fast. Further, even if there is congestion, you can still pay pennies and wait, since your electricity bill isn’t urgent and doesn’t need to be paid within 30 seconds. Certainly it is not a problem now but if fees get permanently high it will. Or, you know, you let your pool hold your funds until you have a larger quantity to cashout. Many have done that during the November/December 2017 fee event. With all the associates problem that come with custodian trust. And if your are a small miner waiting time to collect enough payout to afford the onchain and remain profitable can become simply too long. (Beyond 5$ i doubt many small miner continue..) More use-case, yes I agree. But those extra use-cases (for smaller txns) are already served well by existing solutions such as Paypal and Visa. And MAYBE you’d get more nodes, that’s questionable though, especially when all your supporters specifically tell people not to run a node. I think it is better to have node run by business, high quality, high uptime nodes that relying on average peoples charity to support the network. There is a diminishing return on total number of nodes. We need to have enough to ensure decentralization and censorship resistance. In my opinion the compromise needed to ensure everybody can run a node, even on the cheaper hardware are counterproductive and can potentially lead to a smaller less resilient network globally. You’d be correct. BTC cannot work in the long run in order to buy coffees on chain. Its questionable whether BCH can work for that either when it comes time to pay miners. But BTC isn’t trying to make that work, so that’s irrelevant. BTC is trying to make other things work, and put coffees offchain. Coffees have no risk associated with them. This is the fundamental of the problem. BTC and BCH are completely different project trying to achieve different things. To the point I think it makes less and less sense to compare the too. I am personally into disrupting currency, that definitely involves the possibility of buying coffees onchain (among other things, BCH is just getting dividends token again.. all you need for a decentralized stock market!), that why I am not so interested in BTC. Its more a disagreement on the use-case of cryptocurrency. Are you trying to serve more transactions? If so, you increase resources, and potentially compromise some decentralization. I disagree on the more resources lead to more centralisation. I can fully imagine a large block cryptocurrency with more growth have more total nodes wordwide. If it’s serve more people the demand for node will increase. Or maybe you define decentralization by cheap/easy to run nodes and not by the total number of nodes? It is not quite the same things. Are you trying to resist central banks and governments to prevent inflation of your savings? If so, you compromise some capacity, and move that capacity elsewhere either on layer2 or other chains. So yes, it comes right back to the duality of capacity and decentralization. I thing the number one defense against government is growth. Crypto has to be big to be government resistant. Only if it growth massively and be used a lot worldwide that it will become politically incorrect to attack it. If you stay small, you will get killed in an heart beat, and running a node or not will not protect you. Anyway that has been discussed a million time. I am only glad two option are tried out, even though I am sadden that so many people want the original scaling way to die, certainly settlement network for second is not without risk and comprise either."

It doesn’t particularly matter until it starts to be distributed, but when it does become public, the value should remain relatively constant. Like fiat currencies, Libra will be backed by something to help prevent its value from being too volatile. Facebook has chosen a selection of real-world currencies to base Libra’s value on, so even if one crashes, it shouldn’t take Libra too far with it. There has been some concern over which currencies will be chosen, however, and whether the addition of new currencies as backing in the future could affect the price of the tokens — raising questions over the monopolistic power of Facebook and the Libra Association. In comparison, there is nothing backing Bitcoin other than what people are willing to pay for it. That’s why it can experience such huge swings in the value, and why the next halving event in 2020 could cause such disruption as miners temporarily hold on to their Bitcoin rather than selling, to help inflate the value to make the process profitable again."

Not at all trying to impress you, but impress upon you that its possible if you dont give up. It works but you REALLY need to bunker down and get serious. This isnt get rich quick. I'll outline it for you as quick as I can... 1 - do not EVER trade on margin. you'll get reckt. Not worth it. Theres nothing wrong with making $500 or $1000 or $2000 or $5000 every week by taking smaller gains a few times a day or over the course of a few days or week depending on your trading habits. How greedy are we where thats not enough? 2 - do the free class on babypips site. even if you already did it, do it again and refresh. start clean. you have a lot of mental shit built up you need to get rid of ASAP. 3 - learn 3 to 5 technical indicators. I mean really get to know them. trade with them and feel them out. You'll gravitate to ones you like. 4 - Pick 2 of those indicators and MASTER the hell out of them. Youre going to look at numbers and stats and news and books and people and everything differently when you master those 2 or 3 indicators. again... MASTER 2 or 3 indicators you like. MASTER THEM. 5 - this really should be #1, but you need to keep a log book early on... what you are trading, why you are trading it, what indicators you use, what your exit point is, did you follow your rules, profit or loss, etc. do this the first several months of trading at least until you know inside and out what works and what doesnt. you will clearly see on paper whats working. its a no brainer at that point. here is everything in a nutshell... \"keep doing what works.\" 6 - trade on paper if you can. could be stocks, precious metals, crypto, whatever. if you need skin in the game you can trade stocks on robinhood or trade crypto with no leverage. It doesnt even have to be much. It could $1000 and you have $200 in each stock following your indicator of choice. then when you have it all figured out, start trading larger amounts over time. Its possible if you dont give up. Also... dont ever listen to anyone on the internet. Stop wasting time on reddit. No one gives a shit about you, except for yourself. Teach yourself. Learn.

The selling isn't increasing, it is decreasing since the supply is inelastic and people hoard instead of spending. Miners can only hoard the profit that results from REVENUE - COSTS. Revenue (in dollars) increased months ago, costs (in dollars) did not, which allowed more hoarding and reduced sell pressure. Look, you're confusing yourself because there's six different things that we're talking about here: 1. REVENUE in BTC 2. REVENUE in dollars 3. COSTS in BTC 4. COSTS in dollars. 5. PROFIT from the perspective of a single miner 6. PROFIT from the perspective of all miners aggregated. It doesn't matter whether we are considering the perspective of a single miner or all miners aggregated, the resulting economics is (and must be) the same. When PRICE goes up, revenue in BTC remains unchanged, COSTS in dollars remains unchanged, but revenue in dollars goes up and COSTS in btc goes down. After PRICE goes up, the saturation point shifts and more miners are purchased and deployed, which increases the hashrate as we are observing. When hashrate rises, REVENUE in BTC (PER individual miner!) decreases while costs in dollars stays flat. Or another way of looking at it, when hashrate rises, REVENUE (for all miners worldwide) stays flat but COSTS in both dollars and BTC rises. So when price rises, PROFIT = REVENUE - COSTS increases, which reduces sell pressure because, as you said, most miners would prefer to hodl. When new hashrate catches up to the saturation point, PROFIT decreases because COSTS increases while REVENUE stays flat (on a global perspective) or, if we look at it from a single miner's perspective who isn't deploying new miners, PROFIT decreases because REVENUE decreases while COSTS stays flat. Either way we look at it, the result is the same: PROFIT has decreased which results in higher sell pressure because fewer coins can be hodl'd. /u/Rhamni"

It is extremely cheap (less than a penny or so usually) but you're right that is a hurdle and something the dapp organizers will need to deal with if they want to use gas stations. I hope that Nano does continue to improve but these points have been discussed before and there was a hard line drawn in the sand that no features will be added that compromise the speed and feelessness (probably rightly so). So we know interoperability/smart contracts/stability etc will never be added from those discussions. Privacy is probably on that list as well but there may be a way to do it invented in the future. One of the reasons I left the Nano community is that I argued those cases and the devs made it clear that Nano is limited by design and they have no plans on changing that."

That trivial, almost throwaway, little fact is actually far more important than the oft-quoted marketing that \"Nano is feeless\". Bitcoin Cash, Dash, and others, can rightly claim that a $0.001 fee is neither here or there financially. But the difference is vital to granny. Granny don't wanna know about no fee field. She doesn't wanna be trained on its use. She doesn't want to worry about whether she's entered too low or too high a fee. This difference means that the User eXperience for the wallet is absolutely gorgeous - and you can demonstrate to granny how to install the wallet, and receive and send funds in under 2 minutes as a result. No other coin can do this. That ease of use was what made the Apple MacIntosh go viral. Nano is the only cryptocurrency that can go viral. 2. Nano works. Reliably. Not vapourware. Not like the unreliable Lightning Network. It simply works. It does what it says on the tin. 3. Nano's Game Theory means that it only becomes more and more decentralized over time. Almost all other coins have a financial incentive for node/mine operators - that results in creeping centralization. Not Nano."

Effectively /r/btc was used for Bitcoin discussion for about 4 years. - /r/btc was and still is used for all Bitcoin and Bitcoin fork discussions but it turned into a primarily subreddit when Bitcoin Cash was created on August 1st 2017.

Places where they hate their shitty fiat, and banking services are sparse and exploitative. It is these people, the ones that really NEED it, that will be using it first. And the massive resources and \"head start\" doesn't mean jack squat when you have an inferior product. Look at AOL, or Blockbuster Video, or any of the dozens of Automobile companies that were created before Ford. Simply put, if your product is worse, you are going to loose. Google was far from the first search engine, but it destroyed Yahoo, Excite, Altavista, Lycos and many others that had HUGE resources and a head start. Why? It was better. That is Nano right there. Now, I agree that some other crypto, like Ripple, can compete. However, ultimately these people will choose zero fees over even a tiny fee. A fee is a fee. Ripple is NOT free to use, Nano is.

You can then use this Dai and lend it to via Compound and gain interest. Obviously, this is cool because you can earn interest from the capital that you invested, without having to cash out. Lets say you put in $10,000 in ETH. You can be gaining (15% interest annually via Compound) by just HODLing. Whenever you want, you can just pull your ETH out the CDP as well. The only thing you have to be careful about is not getting liquidated. MakerDao are Compound are basically banks where you can borrow and lend. Without needing proof of identity, credit, etc. Essentially anyone with an internet connection can use this, and that's a big deal for the 1.7 billion people in the world who are unbanked.

TRAC because transparency in supply chains, specifically food is important to me. And they are already compliant with the EU. USDA is likely coming in Q4 2019. NEO because ETH won't be the only dApp platform. And not being forced into learning Solidity is crucial. Being developer friendly by creating SDK's for C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, etc will help developers build shit along with an NEP-5 token. VET because, shit bro, they legit are making moves in supply chains. BAT because Brave Browser is fucking dope whether you like ads or not. The ads aren't invasive, and I still get paid for seeing them. I click on the ones that interest me. And that's about it. LTC because they are a testbed for BTC, most sites that accept BTC also accept LTC (adoption), they actually market themselves (UFC, NFL, etc), and the network is secure. Not saying it is revolutionary, but at least for the next couple of cycles, I think LTC is worth owning. ONT is focused on enterprise adoption without altering the enterprise's business logic much. If they can pull it off, it will be a relatively easy sell for businesses rather than saying trying to convert current business logic to solidity for an ERC-20 token or whatever platform example. Those are my thoughts. Still thinking I need IOTA, but I want more ETH and VET."

You _need_ to have them come in to a booth every once in a while at least. It's similar to the use of safe deposit boxes by crypto whales because they're physically secure. People scrutinize electronic voting because most actual electronic voting machines today aren't secure at all, and it's easier to educate the public on paper ballot security than on computer security. Their eyes gloss over when we explain why it _needs_ to be open source software, but they don't consider that all paper ballots are \"open source\".

That agent is currently in federal prison because he stole bitcoin from Silk Road wallets Also interesting tidbit, the information that the lead undercover agent staged the hit, then stole evidence from the investigation, was all suppressed and hidden from the jury because “it involved an active investigation” THATS why they dropped the murder for hire charge because the entire incident was fabricated by a crooked cop who pocketed money from the investigation Prosecution didn’t need the bad look in front of the jury when they could get a life sentence from the drug stuff anyway I’m not saying that Ross shouldn’t suffer the consequences of his actions, he obviously did some bad stuff, and very bad things were bought and sold on the website But everyone always focuses on the ordering a hit part, and no one seems to know about the crooked cop that set the whole thing up from start to finish right before stealing from the drug kingpin he was investigating. And the fact that the feds suppressed that evidence from the jury should tell you how fucked up that situation looks for the investigators"

  "reddit": "Bitcoin is like the stuff that goes down the ethernet cable. Increasing the block size is like adding more wires to the cable: At some point it won't fit in your wall. Instead, why not change what's going through the wires? Add TCP, add HTTP, etc. Increasing block size is like adding 1000 horsepower to a 100 horsepower car and expecting to go 10X faster. It doesn't work that way. There are no solutions, only compromises."

  "reddit": "A throughput limit of 1.67 KB/s is ultra-conservative, to the point of being extremely counter-productive. BTC could easily have handled a 100 times more throughput than that and remained decentralized enough to remain uncensored. Satoshi himself said so: Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node. The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. His points are even more valid today than they were in late 2008. Core stonewalled a block-size-limit increase hard fork in order to change the scaling roadmap from one that embraced on-chain scaling to one that favored ultra-conservative block sizes and experimental off-chain solutions like lightning network that would take years to be consumer-ready and might never actually find a product-fit. And they implemented this change in the scaling roadmap without any consensus from the wider Bitcoin community. It was a terrible plan, implemented through dishonest and unethical means, that set back cryptocurrency adoption back by several years."

In the report they simulated between 24 and 100ms latency between masternodes with good results. I think this is realistic. It's a positive report. More than any other chain has yet to provide regarding TPS at this time. I look forward to further live network testing."

Despite all signs that r/BTC is trying to fight for Bitcoin as it was intended, these false accusations are voted up to shake public opinion. There's so much evidence of shady practices from BTC and BSV camps that any rational person should be running a mile, instead what these supporters do is abuse BCH supporters of doing the things they are doing, despite evidence to prove them wrong (I. E. Open mod logs prove the lack of censorship, versus BTC and BSV subs refusing to show the reasons for their absolutely rampant censoring - hint, if you don't fall exactly in line with the interests of the moderators, you will be banned. Not just down voted, banned and called a liar). This is just one drop in the ocean in a huge list of shady dealings, including Adam Back admitting to running a large team of people to spread his message, and Greg doing everything from running mass botnets to control the narrative on Wikipedia to being heavily instigated in the false flag attack that was blamed on the BCH supporters - add to that his huge pre-mining of LTC and a multitude of other disgraceful practices and this guy shouldn't be allowed near any means of development access. The best you have is that Roger, who has supported Bitcoin since he first learned about it, and has never once strayed from his original message and intention, actually went as far as to pay some people to moderate (openly, and fairly, you're free to prove otherwise) who support his view on Bitcoin. Just like he's invested in dozens of startups in the past. Roger has never changed. He continues to put his money where his mouth is and support his vision of Bitcoin, and he's willing to fight hard to bring it to fruition. The issue is... If Bitcoin succeeds, then there's no need for a ton of other crypto currencies. So I feel some people in this sub try to vote based on their investments, rather than logical process."

As to whether or not it would be delisted from exchanges, i can't comment as i imagine various exchanges base their listings off of their own criteria, if its's just based off of price then new coins would never get listed, therefore never rise in price as they won't be easily available, catch 22. Transaction fees don't get paid to people who run validators, those fees are burnt, out of the total 100b XRP in existence something like 9 million or so have been burnt. This is not expected to push the price in any way shape or form as is intended as a anti spam method as the transaction fee starts to rise rapidly if someone starts making loads of transactions. The incentive behind running a validator is simply that the company, or person, has their own input on the way the XRPL is run, this may not be a good method in your opinion, but is meant in a way such as to prevent centralisation of consensus over time that incentivised consensus methods can lead to.

Now you take out a loan in DAI, with the ETH in your savings account as collateral. Your hope is that the return on whatever you do with the DAI (eg buy more ETH) is higher than the interest you pay on your loan. Because the difference is your profit. It's a little bit similar to borrowing money with your credit card, investing it in the stock market, and hope that the return on your stock market investment is higher than the interest on your credit card loan. Financial advisors would generally not recommend this. (Before you invest, you pay down your high interest loans.

The reason that Nano is faster at settlement than blockchains like BTC is not due to it being more centralized. It's down to its completely different architecture. Because it's asynchronous and takes the form of a block-lattice, its scalability is not constrained by the same limitations that affect a single blockchain like BTC. Its solution space for the scalability trilemma is different. I used this analogy in another comment a few days ago. If there is a power vs. top speed dilemma for horses, it would be a different solution space to the power vs. top speed dilemma for motor vehicles.

A csgo clone for example could use this to host tournaments and immediately payout the winning team, no clauses, no ummm we actually have no money, no charge backs. It would be quite useful. A lot of existing games are built with unreal engine too so I am quite excited by this. Other uses could be arpgs with rare drops that can be sold for nano in game, the nano coming from the playerbases subscription or buyers. Poe is a good comparison of a thriving economy that a clone could implement such a system."

Its aimed at removing the need for centralized banking institutions that control and inflate the money supply. To give some context, Nano is more centralized than Libra and most crypto projects lol.. no. not even close. But it appears you don't understand either of the coins you are talking about... To say libra isn't centralized, is like saying that the US dollar isn't centralized, because there are lots of other banks besides FedRes banks... From the Libra white paper: The association is the only party able to create (mint) and destroy (burn) Libra you have a single entity responsible for controlling the supply.. Its centralized as fuck."

  "reddit": "Basically the video says that the entire bitcoin history has been one massive Elliot wave anding with the 2017 bull run. According to the Elliot wave pattern, an ABC correction must take place. The bear market we’ve had for the last year, can be seen as wave A of the correction and the current bullish rally, the Wave B. The video states that Wave C will be coming in the next year and either we will double top at 20k and slowly head back to 3k for a double bottom before taking on new heights, or could potentially drop lower than 3k (if we are in a zig zag correction). Do you think this is viable? It’s hard to argue with some one with expertise and who is looking long term and at the whole of BTCs history. But the sentiment is very bullish right now and with the halvening happening next year, I don’t see how it could go this low? However, the very fact that the sentiment is so bullish right now could be a sign we are about to head to new lows.... Thoughts?"

However nothing is going to be deployed or worked on. Everyone is just expecting it to go up magically just because \"it happened before so it will happen again\". I think it will instead drop down to about 7200 and it will stay there for a long time until a product and usage of the actual coin takes a foothold. In the meantime other technologies are coming out that are filling the gaps BTC promised. Like IOTA, Ethereum, Nano, Monero, BAT. I'm certain more newer solid technologies will come out and unless BTC commits to only be a SoV instead of trying to be everything, it will die."

  "reddit": "Guess what? BCH cant scale to be a global payment platform. Its not fast enough no matter how big the blocks are, and big blocks just encourage bloating which ultimately leads to centralization. Nothing about BCH works. L2 solutions can actually scale to meet global demand. And by what actual facts and not your biased, useless opinion do you base this upon? What year do you think this is when even full 32mb blocks every 10 minutes is massive? I consume far more bandwidth and computing power watching Netflix on my smartphone. Satoshi himself would disagree with you, which he outlined more than a few times that on-chain scaling is viable. BCH already proved hand over fist that the world doesn't end if block size is left to float naturally, which is now far more enhanced for this task than BTC ever was with CTOR, Graphene, xThin, and even more ideas on the table like subchains/weakblocks, Avalanche integration, etc. “Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node. The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. \" Nothing about BCh works...except that BCH has worked just fine for over two years, just like Bitcoin did from 2009-2015 on Satoshi's original on-chain design without any L2 garbage being sold as \"scaling\". BTC was crippled on-chain for no legitimate reason, and has demonstrated publicly several times that the result is high fees and long confirmation times, with unpredictable behavior. Try again, liar"

Instead of people buying BTC they spent it on the cheaper BCH, because hey its the real \"Bitcoin\" too right? When it forked it was almost identical to BTC, so at the time it was almost like they printed free bitcoins and some people were \"ok\" with it because now they have double the coins. This is one of the problems I have with BCH, there was suppose to be a max amount of BTC, if you can just fork it and make more Bitcoins whenever you want and claim they are just as legit as original BTC, it kinda defeats the purpose of a supply cap don't you think?"

Its a hassle to check the purity. 4) Harder to be robbed of the asset if you don't do anything stupid 5) No need to pay for storage fees that you would pay if you put gold in a vault (which is problematic anyway because you have counterparty risk doing this) 6) Derivatives resistant (holding the asset is the only sure way to know you get both coins in a rare chain split and also useful to lend) 7) Supply is perfectly known and limited 8) Potentially can make a return with Bitcoin through lending / LN 9) Can spend Bitcoin far easier than gold if you wish to do so 10) Bitcoin has more volatility but it clearly has more upside while gold is being challanged 11) Median of exchange for all things digital online. Gold is not regularly exchanged for anything. nbsp; This list is sales pitchy and I've posted it before but I think its accurate."

  "reddit": "The 'Store of Value' assumes there is any perceived value in the item in the first place. As in, a need or utility being satisfied. For fiat, it's the ability to pay off taxes in legal tender. It's also necessary that a Store of Value should have a reasonable chance of holding its value long term - perhaps, as savings for retirement. BTC certainly does not perform this function having dropped 5% in the last hours. The short page covers this well: According to the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which is represented by the , money's ability to store value is more important than its function as a medium of exchange. Cambridge claims that the is derived from its ability to store value. This is contrary to economists' belief that demand arises because money is needed for exchange. It goes on: Insofar as an investment is speculative, it should not be considered a store of value because it lacks stability. An asset should only be considered a store of value if it is stable against future . At various times throughout history, people and nations have famously made the mistake of believing that they could \"store value\" in speculative instruments, misunderstanding that ones personal choice to invest in a speculative asset does not automatically convert that asset into a proper and predictable store of value. Examples of assets that are not traditionally considered stores of value: – A share of ownership of a publicly-traded company – digital currencies So, perhaps it doesn't matter whether the Cambridge or Fisher theories are correct, because crypto is not a Store of Value in the first place - it's a commodity, like a lump of coal is a commodity. Maybe it's a fairly stable commodity or maybe it isn't. But it can still be a Medium of Exchange without ever being a Store of Value."

I can't get the connection between Bitcoin, which was to free humankind from a central monetary system too BCCI.

I have zero doubt about Ethereum's future as a whole, as I hold Vitalk Buterin in the highest esteem, moreso than Satoshi, in fact, due to Buterin's choice not to adopt anonymity, and I hold similar esteem for all Ethereum developers. However, the reality I see is that due to the project being open source, the VeChain team is able to redirect a bulk of their prospective clients by tailoring the Ethereum codebase specifically to communicated corporate desires, and then deploying the result. If you compare the activity between the two blockchains, you will find that VeChain is on the verge of eclipsing Ethereum already, and the price is only half a cent because there is an incredible amount of presumably faked, market-tailoring sell walls present on Binance, in total 74BTC, for an unknown actor to maintain an artificially low cost, so they can scoop up as much as they can before it inevitably explodes. All I'm saying is that when it becomes apparent to the public at large the specific level of effect the corporate support provided by PWC, DNV GL, and recently Deloitte has had in global logistical industries (shipping, insurance, etc.) adopting VeChain for all their transactions, there will be a large shift in the speculative market and a lot of the influx of capital may be sapped from Ethereum holders in addition to pouring in from non-crypto holders who finally see names they recognize, like Walmart, working with a specific blockchain so they can invest in that token with greater confidence. I'm no seer, and I've got no crystal ball, but that's just the way the wind is blowing from where I'm standing in August 2019. Cheers to you regardless of which way we sail into the future, fellow blockchain enthusiast, and thank you for providing a civil discourse."

People buying houses they couldn't afford weren't hobos living below the poverty line. Basically, if the value of goods imported from China is $10 and the value of goods exported is $5, there is a trade imbalance. Now That imbalance has grown higher, favoring China. So what you're saying is raising the tariffs on China (making Chinese goods more expensive in US) will cause Americans to buy more Chinese goods? Because, being American, we like to pay as much as possible? Makes sense. So suicide rates at all time High levels in the Us don’t matter because of what’s going on in other countries? Okay. No. If suicide rates are indicative of failing economy (they have nothing to do with each other) America's low (among the lowest in the world) suicide rates would suggest either that economies in the rest of the world are failing much harder, or that American economy is thriving.

A few thousand bucks can inflate the market caps of many top 50 coins by 6-7 figures. So, it's only really fair to say that projects are overvalued relative to these artificial caps.

And then when you succeed at that, there are plenty of chains which can accomodate that many people, if BTC happens to be full at that time (which is yet to be seen, who knows at that time maybe decentralization concerns are gone, and we've raised blocksize). So BTC would have no impact on changing the financial system from one where banks are in control, to one where individuals are in control BTC already has an impact; individuals are already in control of their own money. And if in the future BTC can't handle enough individuals to satisfy you, there are plenty of spin-off chains that can. BTC has impacted all of them, BTC has inspired all of those spin-offs, every crypto in existence.. The only reason they exist is due to BTC. In fact, BTC has inspired an entire decentralized blockchain industry that will be used even beyond finance."

Today we have a trickle down tax structure. The FED funds all this bullshit ineffectively\\ and with no oversight. It IS in fact theft and you are silly for not seeing that. As a country who claims freedom, we should at the very least to have an option to support certain welfare structures as we see fit.

Which makes it great if you want to transfer something using a cryptocurrency and it has to be extra secure. But to think that Bitcoin is the future protocol for most of the decentralised p2p transactions, that's delusional - it's too slow and too pricey. and yes, LN is just 18 months away, but nano does cheap and fast p2p transactions better, right here, right now.

What makes you believe brave will be able to provide better ads than google? That's my own opinion, and only time will tell I suppose. You may be right, but I think the notion that one's web browser can predict ad preferences at least as good as Google is plausible; and all without sacrificing privacy (though I personally think it can do better, but like I said we may disagree on that). You also haven’t explained how incentivizing click farm fraud will decrease it. The primary source of fraud in digital advertising is actually click fraud by bots, which I think are definitely more easily detected by your browser than Google. Google uses some tricks (cookies, etc.) to infer whether a click is genuine or not (i.e. bits and pieces of how you interact with certain sites), but your browser has the whole picture. It knows where you click, where you are scrolling on the page, when you are away from the computer, etc., and again - all without any third party having this data. Click farm fraud is very difficult to combat, but it's much less cost effective to do. The best you can earn from a click farm would \\$4-5 per day per person, before you pay all your workers. Perhaps there may be some slick tricks the Brave devs could employ to detect this. Maybe in the future, Brave may also be able to combat this more effectively than Google. For the time being though, they can simply make Brave Rewards unavailable in regions where click farming is viable (which they do..)"

  "reddit": "Super late reply for me here, but better late than never. I'll try to keep my response a bit more general this time. I will start by clarifying the Ethereum fee question. The first thing to understand is that miners create a fee market. The cost of a transaction is related to how full the network is and what fees miners are willing to accept into blocks. This is basically the same as Bitcoin. Note that this may change in the somewhat near future with . The other key fact is that 1 gwei is NOT the smallest amount of ETH. 1 gwei can be subdivided another 1000000000 times. So if the price of ETH goes up 10x and block space demand stays the same, there is not reason that the price of a transaction needs to increase. The price could be dropped to 0.1 gwei instead of 1 gwei. Without scaling, which is very seriously in the works, I imagine fees will increase as price goes up since price going up will probably mean more people are using the network. But as of right now, the network is near full capacity all the time: . Reading you original comment, you are partially correct when you say: which is the unfortunate case currently with Ethereum, where the intrinsic value of the token causes fees to increase as its usage increases Although, I am arguing that the usage of the network, and not the value of the ETH, is the driving factor. While they are related, they are not necessarily causal. I think this is also the root of one of my critiques of VeChain. Ethereum has a block size limit and throughput limit for a reason. It maintains a certain level of decentralization in which anyone can run a node or be a miner without too much trouble. The whole roadmap of ETH 2.0 is an attempt to improve upon the throughput and keep costs down while still allowing most people to validate the blockchain and keep it decentralized. ETH 2.0 will require a minimum of 62,500 validators staking 32 eth each (although you can run multiple validators if you multiply your stake). The optimum number is closer to \\300,000 validators. Figuring out how to allow large amounts of data throughput (transactions) without requiring a data center style setup to store the data and process the transactions is one of the biggest issues being tackled in crypto. In this way, the VeChain network is uniquely motivated to increase the amount of traffic on the network, and not decrease it; This is potentially problematic from a decentralization standpoint. Increasing throughput means that the network needs to store more data and quickly process more transactions. If transactions are incentivized to increase, the requirements needed to run a node will increase, limiting the number of entities that can be nodes and centralizing the network. From our conversations, it seems like VeChain is taking an approach that does not see this as a problem. Its may be 5 times more decentralized than EOS, but I would argue that's probably not good enough. 101 nodes is a far cry from a min. 62,500 for ETH 2.0, even if there are a large number of people who run many validators. Ethereum still allows small fish to participate in the network. The last part of my argument is that a sub-network can easily more toward centralization, but cannot easily move to decentralization. For example, a permissioned or semi-permissioned private chain built on Ethereum can pick features that allow fine tune the amount of decentralization they want, with the starting point as the public Ethereum chain, and move to more centralized throughput. The other way doesn't work. You can not build on a version of VeChain with more than 101 validators. That is your starting point. There may be use cases and people that want to build on VeChain, and the tooling and infrastructure may start out better, but my bet is that the network with greater flexibility and with access to a truly decentralized base layer, if wanted, is a stronger value proposition in the long run. I expect there to be VeChain-like products that are built using permissioned Ethereum clients that businesses can subscribe to use like SAAS. They will work out of the box. Maybe VeChain will be one of these products, especially if infrastructure emerges to bridge the two. I'm still not convinced that having the whole system of VET tokens held by random people who may not really be incentive aligned with the businesses that want to use VeChain. But I may be seeing all of this through Western, Ethereum Bubble colored glasses! So we shall see! Or maybe they both fail and we all end up living in a Hyper-bitcoinized world where half the world's energy is going to Bitcoin mining and every day more people are born but no more Bitcoin are minted."

It does not, for example, mean \"survival of the most moral\" or \"most popular.\" Additionally, as you pointed out, survival strategies are not always compatible so they do not always (or even often) consolidate. \"Survival of the fittest\" is also reductionist, I'll give you that much, even though I don't think that's what you meant. Strategies that are less fit than others for their environment survive all the time. The actual principle is that the systems that are more fitted to their environment will have the highest likelihood of surviving/being successful, random acts of god notwithstanding of course. We live in an environment where the strategies that work actually work. They would not work if consumers behaved differently than they do now. On top of that, the word \"superiority,\" like \"fit\" or \"best,\" has many literal meanings. I suspect you are thinking in moral terms, or maybe even efficiency as a goal, but that isn't what \"fit\" means in the survival of the fittest. Morality is a strategy, not an environment in this case (If you treat morality as an environment then survival of the fittest might describe which actions win or lose at being moral, but that's a derivative system and it assumes a lot.) and since it's a strategy it isn't always the one that is used, especially not if morality as a strategy leads to failed companies. If the market deems them unfit then they simply are. At the end of the day, you almost had it. We don't live in an egalitarian reality, but that reality becomes less and less about raw domination every day as we shape it. It IS one that respects survival of the fittest though, it just might not seem like it if you assume that fit means \"moral\" or you can't see how the environment is changing. I think Bezos said it perfectly himself: \"If we're not one of those important lasting companies born of the internet we will have no one to blame but ourselves and we will be extremely disappointed in ourselves, but there are no guarantees.\" He took a guess at an effective strategy for the environment he was in, but if that strategy had failed it would have been no one's fault other than his for not using a more effective one. He pandered to the machine and the clarity of his understanding seems to have paid off. Crypto is the same. Coins that are fit will win out over those that aren't. It's up to the market to choose whether privacy, speed, accountability, volume, whatever is the thing they want most, and any coin that picks the wrong one to be relentless about will have no one else to blame for its lack of adoption."

Anytime the price touched 10,400 it was immediately met with a red $200 candle, the market maker decided to not let the market go up anymore and to exhaust the bulls. Finally, today, they decided it was time - probably because of a lower orderbook that would allow for high degree of slippage downwards."

Bitcoin could have leveraged that to onboard millions of users, which would have led to the network of Bitcoin users/merchants growing rapidly, which would have made it even more useful in payments, leading to a positive feedback loop that would have led to rapid exponential adoption. Tons of technologies/services saw rapid exponential growth in their early years, including Facebook and Google. Why you think a decentralized cryptocurrency that makes finance permissionless and transfers nearly free could not do that is inexplicable if you were actually a proponent of cryptocurrency. The way you play-down the opportunity that Bitcoin had, and try to convince the Bitcoin community that rapid adoption is not possible, and that therefore a stifling block size limit is okay, indicates that you don't want to see global mass-adoption of cryptocurrency."

When we look at OpenMarketCap, which purports to pull data only from trusted exchanges, we see Bitcoin’s actual share of the daily trading market is closer to 48%. True Bitcoin Dominance The same platform showed BTC’s share of the market’s trading volume to be as low as 33% during the spring while altcoins were pumping hard."

Bitcoin already is valued relatively high compared to alts. So alts have much more upwards opportunity. How likely is it that BTC does a 10x? Other projects could do a 10x and would not even be close to ATH. Is BTC really twice as promising as all other cryptos combined? I doubt it.

That means the advocates and companies that would be promoting merchant adoption and retail usage will not be, because they know that it will lead to a situation like in late 2017, when the backlog grew, and fees spiked to $40 per transaction. People were waiting a week for a confirmation, with $30 fees, during the backlog. The base layer simply is not made for 1M tps (which is what we will need!) without compromizing decentralization. We can put aside the debate over whether it can do 1 million transactions per second for another time. The base layer could do 3,000 tps and maintain sufficient decentralization to remain uncensored, and that would enable orders of magnitude more commerce with cryptocurrency. 3 tps is absurdly conservative, and just anti-cryptocurrency. It shows no regard for spreading cryptocurrency usage around the world and providing people with the tools to engage in censorship resistant commerce. ever tried LN? LN is barely used and its collateral has been decreasing. It suffers from a very high routing failure rate, high capital lock-up costs, and has in no way demonstrated that it can be anything more than a niche product and substitute for on-chain transactions. Most importantly of all, Core should not have changed Bitcoin's scaling roadmap without getting consensus. The only reason Core was able to change the roadmap was because /r/Bitcoin was censored to prevent a switch over to a competing client. That shows it wasn't even close to having consensus.

Litecoin is in a whole other universe from Feathercoin, aside from the obvious similarity of being a Bitcoin-clone PoW coin. Feathercoin was a . Eventually they had to change their PoW to another algorithm because of the threat or actual occurrence of 51% attacks. There used to be tons of coins with SHA256 or Scrypt PoW, which have now all either gone to merge-mining for security (Doge, Syscoin, etc), or tried to continue life by hard-forking their PoW (Feathercoin for example). It seems like there can be only one \"top dog\" coin for any given PoW algorithm, especially once that PoW has several generations of dedicated hardware behind it. So, what does this have to do with Litecoin? There are four or five generations of Scrypt ASICs that are securing the LTC network now. Whether or not this is truly valuable is besides the point of whether or not LTC is clearly in another class from Feathercoin. I would argue that this puts LTC in a class above BCH and BSV as well, as the network is more secure - there is no looming threat of 51% on Litecoin."

Proven track record is related, as I would consider it another form of security. As much as I like Monero, they hardfork every six months implementing new cryptography and implementations of that cryptography. Yes, this is necessary to \"upgrade\" the network, but it is also risky. The market seems to value lower-risk, longer track record cryptocurrencies. Decred is similar except they've also introduced additional wrinkle of proof-of-stake consensus and voting on network hardforks via ticket buying."

  "reddit": "I researched dusk more. They know that they can't use this block creation protocol directly for consensus, because long-range-attacks. So their blockchain actually has another layer where users lock up big safety deposits. And this layer has control to decide which of the valid blocks created by the block creation protocol have the opportunity to be added to the blockchain. They can censor anything from the block creators that they don't like. So the bribery/soft-fork attack from my paper would be able to take control of Dusk. We would take control of the security-deposit layer, and then use that to censor all block creation that we disapprove of. The mechanism they invented really is amazing, but having zero security against long-range-attacks makes it useless in it's current form. And any attempt to combine it with security deposits to solve the long-range-attack problem will make it vulnerable to the attack from my paper. The long-range-attack problem for more than 2 weeks in the history is solvable by just requiring everyone to come online once every 2 weeks. So all we need is to find a way to solve the long-range-attack for every block between 2 weeks ago and now, without using any safety deposits, and then we will have solved PoS. You might imagine that you could use the fork-choice rule to prevent long-range-attacks, but it doesn't work. Not 100% of addresses that can participate in block creation are participating, so it is always possible for the attacker to have a higher participation rate than the main chain."

Vegas with BTC would be worse.. I have seen people hit progressive jackpots, only to be told five other people hit it at the same time, and that they wouldn't receive the full jackpot. I have a relative who hit a 250k progressive jackpot, only to be awarded $22k. I believe, even based on my limited knowledge of the chain, that this could easily be fixed. Money laundering and failure to claim winnings.. Say, in online poker, etc.. Bring poker back by giving up some privacy, and allowing better tracking of winnings - merge it with dApps that can handle our income/taxes for us. I would gladly give up some privacy for a lot more freedom. You can also make sure that Casinos have machines that are paying out accordingly, and no longer allow for faulty claims of machine failure, to keep from paying winners. No more paper bags. I don't know if the mob is still taking off the top, but a blockchain ran Vegas seems like it would improve trust, not just with the visitors, but with future leaders that could potentially re-write how we experience, as many somewhat called it..

What contributors do in their personal life is irrelevant to me. Religious affiliations, whether they hold altcoins, work on altcoins, mine altcoins, are sponsored, not sponsored, it’s all irrelevant to me. All I care about is the code and the process. It matters when they profit from crippling the project. Lets not conflate two entirely separate things, the debates in Bitcoin are done with mathematics and the law of conservation of energy, that’s how Bitcoin works and how Satoshi designed it, it’s called Nakamoto consensus.

There's no way any region of the world could be excluded from accessing data propagating through a peer-to-peer network with that many nodes spread across dozens of countries around the world. yes it's in its infancy, just like BTC was 10 years ago. Bitcoin worked far better in its infancy than LN does today, three years after its white paper. Moreover, not everything that starts off not working ends up working well. Some things simply cannot work due to fundamental shortcomings in their basic design, and the LN could very well be one of them. Resting everything on LN, when Bitcoin could easily scale far more by just increasing throughput, is a terrible development strategy that shows no regard for cypherpunk values. People weren't about to adopt Bitcoin. It was another speculative bubble which had to burst. Nonsense. Transaction volume was more than doubling year over year from 2009 to 2017 when the limit got hit. Network technologies can and do see massive exponential growth when they capture the public's imagination. Bitcoin was poised to see rapid exponential adoption when it had captured the world's imagination in late 2017. It could have easily onboarded millions of users and merchants in that period, and that larger userbase would have made Bitcoin vastly more useful in commerce, which would have created a positive feedback loop of further encouraging adoption. Also Bitcoin Cash was in existance already. So why didn't people start using BCH? I've explained this to you half a dozen times: BTC hijacked the 'Bitcoin' brand. It takes years to build a brand. It will take years for BCH to build the brand that allows it to get to where Bitcoin was in late 2017, on the verge of global mass-adoption. baseless assumptions and excuses from your side not mine.

How many times a week do you use your bank card to pay for stuff in stores? For me it's at least every two days, sometimes once every three days but mostly ever day. So let's give 10 million people 2 transaction per week. That's about 1.5 million tx a day. Theoretically it's possible that with 100% segwit use you can do 2 million tx a day. But you will never have 100% standard 192 byte transactions. Some transactions have lots of inputs. And next to that those 1.5 milion transactions won't be smoothly divided among the 144 blocks you have per day. So with a 100% guarantee I can say that if 10 million people are using Bitcoin once a week, the fees would be over 10 dollars. Which makes it unusable so it will never happen."

This is good because it justifies why zero reward is rational, because these businesses receive rewards through operating profitable business that depend on nano. The more successful their business is the more profit (reward) they receive, and simultaneously the more votes they get naturally allocated to their nodes. This is what we see happening in practice, as the largest nodes tend to be the most popular services."

If you do a quick search you'll find several articles linking them to that casino in Saipan and Why would an ex Mayor of New York defend MEK so much? MEK are an apocalyptic cult who pray for the end of the world and have hundreds of twitter sock puppets trying to create support for their goals of coming to power in Iran. They were also involved in pump n dumps on Bittrex to raise funds until But by then this group had already broken sanctions and the Patriot Act by raising millions of dollars on a US crypto exchange. Giuliani is a close friend of Louis Freeh. Here they are back in the 'good old days' when American politicians served Americans and not strange cults who live in Iranian deserts or on offshore tax havens. Freeh is known in crypto circles because the firm Freeh Sporkin Sullivan conducted the audit-not-an-audit for Tether/Bitfinex. Wait a second. Is that the same raided by the FBI because an unusually high amount of money was passing through it? Yes. also connected to slave labor violations, human trafficking, laundering money for Chinese oligarchs and MEK. And what's Sunlot Holdings connecting ...that goes .. The pieces come together. We've been saying it all along. Bitcoin was created to funnel money to places like and . They couldn't do it via banks and they need a decentralized pseudoanonymous method. Brock Pierce and his buddies already had experience with virtual currencies and assets. They also needed banks to launder the money, such as Noble Bank. Sunlot Holdings and offshore casinos would provide another layer of money laundering. By luring in libertarians, dark web criminals and speculative day traders they manage to create a shareholding network and then use the funds raised from that to finance their agenda. But within short order, Chinese intelligence understood that crypto could be used to finance anti-regime groups in China. Their response - create Bitmain, create ASIC mining farms, take control of bitcoin, and make sure it is the Chinese authorities profiting from it instead of being threatened by it. Also create exchanges and hundreds of shitcoins to lure in even more newbies to crypto. So Bitcoin back fired and the tables turned. It is now used as a weapon against the West, to finance troll farms in hostile regimes, to rob western sucker day traders, to bribe politicians in democracies to support a libertarian and deregulated agenda, and to fund white supremacists and Islamist groups against democracies. The MEK themselves say that so they can also use bitcoin against the West to evade sanctions and fund ops. Small miners in Iran are being banned so that authorities and their cronies have the monopoly. That's all without even considering the massive climate impact occurring silently in the background.

During this obscure 20-month period of a bear market, which has gone from BG's bankruptcy, Nano's development has continued and the technology has greatly improved. Today Nano is very different from the 2017 Raiblocks. Today this cryptocurrency is presented as a new asynchronous technology in which each account is a blockchain, with high energy efficiency, feeless and one of the fastest solutions that the market offers today for P2P payments. Don't be angry, but it's very easy to fall in love with Nano after trying it and consider that many (including myself) come from experiences with BTC or other PoW cryptocurrencies. Using BTC after using Nano is embarrassing. In recent months the ecosystem around Nano is growing and it is easy to amaze people and create new interest.

Also lines of credit differ from loans for exactly that reason. So you don't have to stop by your bank and outline the money you're using for dinner that night or gas the next morning like with actual loans. You prove your financial stability and responsibility and then pay them for their service of providing credit. Them knowing what it's for should never enter the equation PS your fed example is exactly why we need cryptocurrency and also exactly why the 1% hate crypto. It puts money truly in the hands of the people and they can't do anything about it or steal/confiscate it"

Just for some perspective - you're actually asking an upcoming decentralized crypto payments network to process a number of transactions several magnitudes of order bigger than whatever the largest payment processor on earth can handle in a given instant. It certainly won't work for too many reasons if you care to learn about Nano and think about the scenario carefully (distributed proof-of-work spam mitigation will increase difficulty of the transactions when the network is exceedingly stressed, hundreds of principal nodes need to be beyond server grade specs, what entity is going to spend the ungodly massive amount of money to create the proof-of-work necessary to push the ten million transactions as Nano is feeless but not free, etc.).

So the US government MADE money. The farmers aren’t paying that back. So we are losing money. Somehow you think it’s okay for most Americans to be so broke that they need to borrow money to take care of $500 expense instead of maybe looking st the fact that most Americans are broke.

Preventing global warming is obviously a highly concerning issue for many people. Best example is cars, because you can see you have to get emission tests pretty regularly and if your car doesn’t pass you can’t drive it anymore. Yes, because Cars are one of the largest producers of emissions that actively affect the environment. A car produces 4.6 metric tons of CO2 yearly, multiplied by millions upon millions of cars. Cars, large corporations, and things that actively affect the environment are good things to regulate. Something that has a negligible energy effect per country worldwide is not.

  "reddit": "Hey Average Joe (though with that username I imagine you've got some historical interest in crypto), I'd like to give a perspective that differs from what some of the others are saying here. Let's say everywhere on earth accepts BTC as of tomorrow. Do you actually use it or just horde more of it? Realistically, the historic answer to this question has been to horde more of it, and that likely will not change for quite some time. Fiat currency has a bunch of benefits to spending it. Beyond conversation regarding convenience, fiat is good to spend because it is expected to depreciate in value. There are added incentives through the likes of credit card providers that additionally give you bonuses like cash back for using fiat. There is a lot to gain by spending your fiat! Bitcoin, on the other hand, is deflationary, and carries an intrinsic value relative to the sum of the work put in to mint it. If you own Bitcoin, it's because you anticipate it will go up in value. Why would anyone choose to send off appreciating Bitcoin when you can earn benefits from choosing depreciating fiat? With no other variables to the equation, nobody would ever spend BTC. As far as using crypto goes, the \"drive\" to spend or use it comes in avenues and capacities that can't be done with fiat. When you send a unit of crypto, you're actually sending a chunk of data. This data can be leveraged into nuanced functionalities that fundamentally cannot take place with the dollar. You can make transactions with cryptocurrency for things like exchanging virtual assets and artwork, renting cloud computing resources, creating and participating in predictions markets, participating in peer-to-peer lending, authenticating products, and so on. Many of these current usecases are still quite niche and unappealing to end users, as is the nature of a nascent tech, and many of us anticipate that more exciting applications will grow and take hold in the future."

While polar bears and rabid wolves chew on you. Don't worry about hurting my feelings next time tho, don't want you to feel bad."

  "reddit": "There are plenty of folks who go 100% BTC or 100% \"alts\". I'd say just do your own research and make your own conclusions. If the herd is extremely bullish it's usally a good time to take a step back. If the herd is all moving into Bitcoin and dominance is way up, it's usually a good time to start looking at getting back into \"alts\". It's best to stick to some of the bigger names if you're just getting into it, but if you're really convinced by a projects goal you can always trust your gut. A few guides to follow: - Never invest more than you're willing to lose. - Take everything everyone says with a grain of salt. Both advice from investors and especially the news, which is even less trustworthy than the mainstream media, and that's saying something. If it's something you're really interested in, always verify from multiple sources. - Don't leave funds on an exchange. Both as protection against hacks and against your own emotions. It's easier to make a stupid decision when your funds are easily accessed. Better to put them on a hardware wallet. Also be careful which exchange you use, there are some shady ones out there. And avoid KYC as much as possible. Especially on shady exchanges. - If you want to trade, do it with very small amounts as a way to learn how to recognize your common mistakes. And best to just swing trade rather than daytrade. It can be enough to have a small portion of your portfolio set aside specifically for trades to satisfy that urge and avoid dipping into your investments. - Look into things like developer activity, community following, coin supply, volume/liquidity, past performance, dev interviews, reviews, (both pro and contra) etc ... - Don't spread yourself too thin but don't put all your eggs in one basket either. I'd say 4-5 coins is probably more than enough and easiest to cost average with. The more coins you have, the harder it is to keep track of all the news and developments, and the smaller each pot is. Off the top of my head."

Most people don't need very many censorship resistant txns as is, unless you're selling drugs or running an adult website. If grandma is moving her savings to resist inflation from central banks, she's not going to be making very many txns at all. People making $2 a day can't afford $40 on-chain transaction fees, and asking them to use a trusted third party (TTP) that holds their cryptocurrency on their behalf, is putting them in the same position as they are in right now, where TTPs that are vulnerable to government censorship control their money. Well if you're not running your own node, then you are using a TTP, even if you are transacting on chain. But fine. Guess what? They have solutions that they can use on-chain: NANO, LTC, BSV, BCH, etc. They will have to sacrifice less security but hey all you care about is on-chain right? Off-chain on BTC also has a little less security just the same, so like I did before, you can add LN to the list. If they need more security, they'd have to pay for it. That's the free market at work. But, perhaps all of those alts DO offer enough security. If so, great. Crypto has succeeded. Crypto has achieved the things you're complaining about. They have solutions that work, even on their $2 a day wage. All of those alt chains will work for them. People who can afford more can pay for more security. People who can afford less can pay less and still get the same benefits. That's what all small blockers have been saying. This \"technical\" issue is just tradeoffs in either direction. You want more scaling? You sacrifice a little security and decentralization. You want more decentralization? You sacrifice some scaling. Move more or less in each direction, you get less or more in the other direction. You have to be quite arrogant to think that there aren't smart people on both sides of the debate. I can't imagine that you actually want cryptocurrency to make an impact on the world. I can't imagine you don't see the logical holes in your anti-adoption narrative. If you have a poor imagination, that's not my problem. Cryptocurrency ALREADY has made an impact on the world. People are ALREADY using it to solve the problems of censorship and inflation. We are trying not to lose what we've already gained. You are trying to put us at risk of losing those things. We're good. You have solutions for your problems and we do too. What's the problem?"

Litecoin had a fair launch and due to this, all marketing and development salaries are paid from user/fan donations. Litecoin had a 10k block premine in the first 24 hours."

  "reddit": "You're getting a hard-on about \"zero fees\" I touched on zero fees as an example of how you have zero idea about what IOTA will be used for. What gets me going is and . Tell me, what other services do you consume at \"zero fees\" in your daily life? If I use my corporate laptop to access YouTube using the organisation's internet while at work: Am I paying YouTube a fee for their service? If a 14 year old unemployed student walks to the local library to access books and do research for his assignment: Is he paying the Library a fee for their service? When the homeless man walks to the soup kitchen that redistributes donated food, and he is fed for the night: Is he paying the soup kitchen a fee for their service? There are many examples where people access services without paying a fee. Besides.. we're on the topic of a DLT that incentivises adoption by providing M2M data and value transfer for free. The fee issue revolves around machines executing billions of data and value transactions, 24/7 -- 365 -- automatically -- without ongoing human input. To assert this has zero impact on the bottom line shows a severe lack of critical thinking. If you happen to think of some exception that fits \"zero fees\", describe to me the quality of it. Is it of higher quality than things that have fees above zero? OK let's get petty.. Transferring monetary value internationally for free using Nano - instead of sending cash internationally by mail. Faster, cheaper, and more secure. But seriously though.. better than Western Union, a Bank, etc... What incentive does the other party have to provide you reliable, readily available goods/services for \"zero fees?\" In IOTA's case, the network gets faster and more secure with more participants. Win-win. If you develop a zero fee good or service, incentives can come in many forms.. I mean.. Linux is a thing.. Do your \"zero fee\" services make any guarantees about quality and availability? Is there a punishment to that party the data is not delivered when it's needed, given that the counterparty's upside is \"zero fees?\" A guarantee of quality and availability is contextual, based on whether or not the consumer requires it. Minimum acceptable standards exist, where if X of Y reaches Z% - then send A to B. Maybe a threshhold of Amount A is required to execute Algorithm T. Reputation is used to reward/punish nodes. The system will optimise and cleanse itself. As for holding network participants accountable - the system itself is impartial. Say you are running an airline. One of your biggest, and most volatile, expenses is jet fuel and so one of your biggest risks is that the price of jet fuel will spike. One way to protect yourself from swings in fuel price is to hedge your risk by buying derivatives. To take a simple example, you buy a call option, a contract that gives you the option to purchase jet fuel at a certain price during a certain date range. Yep - an Ethereum smart contract use case. So what? Executing a contract based on criteria has got nothing to do with the feeless transfer of data and value. The derivatives industry is interested smart contracts as a way to “streamline increasingly cumbersome and time-consuming processes, and cut costs.” The typical derivatives contains provisions based on conditional logic, i.e. “if then” statements that can be coded into software, e.g. “if price of fuel is greater than X$ on Date Y, transfer Z$ from A to B.” This conditional structure makes them a perfect fit for smart contracts. Yep - an Ethereum smart contract use case. So what? Executing a contract based on criteria has got nothing to do with the feeless transfer of data and value. The information about price, date, and settlement instructions all represent off-chain data that your contract needs. Tell me, dunce, would you put $20 million dollars into a derivatives smart contract that is relying on \"zero fee\" oracles to deliver that data? Would your counterparty agree to rely on such a system? Would your oracles guarantee to reliably and honestly deliver your data inputs, when they stand to gain \"zero fees\" from doing so? Would they be willing to put up staked collateral, as punishment for not fulfilling what was promised to the contract parties, when they are going to be paid \"zero fees?\" What's the most amount of money you and your counterparties would put into such a transaction? Once you arrive at that number, tell me how much of a favor your \"zero fees\" are doing to drive commercial adoption of your platform. Well, dunce, you went from not understanding how companies can benefit from billions of feeless data and value transactions between automated machines, to giving examples about how it's important to have fees for smart contracts. You finish by saying that commercial adoption will only be possible with a fee - because companies won't trust a network that offers feeless transactions, regardless of how the network is secured and configured.. Talking to you has been a waste of time. I can only hope a newb comes along and reads the thread to see how wrong you are, and discounts any contrarian standpoints you tried to assert."

Bitcoin cash's entire model of decentralization falls apart the moment it actually gets any use. Not many nodes can handle those massive blocks. Litecoin is a copy cat shitcoin. EOS is comparable to a MySQL database, it's centralized like Visa and Mastercard. Not really a crypto currency. Bitcoin SV is the stupidest thing to ever exist, it's Bitconnect level of stupid. Tether is a fake stablecoin that has worldwide banking problems and is under investigation for fraud. They are crooks. Binance coin, don't know much about this I think it's more like a stock, so might be worth something if Binance keeps on making money. I've heard that the exchange is working in a grey area legally, so be aware of that. Stellar, a XRP competitor. If you think the XRP system is a load of crap then Stellar probably is too. Monero.

A large amount of latency between nodes resulted in a longer period of time for transactions to propagate throughout the network and receive confirmation. This reduced the rate at which the network could process these transactions in a secure manner.\" So, about that resilience to adverse network conditions eh? 60k TPS with 24 nodes at 24ms latency. 100ms latency? 8.5k TPS. 150ms latency?

  "reddit": "A minor bitch-fest, because what is life for if not to bitch about things on the internet? Yesterday, allegations emerged about issues affecting a certain project, which we'll call X (my point here is about what happened, not about the project it happened to). The initial allegation post () has received 350+ upvotes at a ratio of 92% positive. X's response post ( and also if you want more reading) has received just over 25 upvotes at an 87% ratio. If this was a neutral issue--like, say, the allegations had merit, but X had a reasonable explanation--you might reasonably expect a roughly equivalent number of upvotes for each post. But in fact the initial allegations have turned out to be misleading. Meanwhile, the response from X hasn't cleared up every question, but it's at least been been open and realistic. And yet the misleading piece has received an order of magnitude more love than the rational explanation. This is even more interesting when you note that the project that was shilled at X's expense in the initial allegation post was temporarily pumped to more than double its previous price, and that the allegation post itself received nearly 200 upvotes in the first two hours after its posting, despite pertaining to a relatively unknown project. And it's especially interesting that the allegations were taken up by various crypto news outlets, including those whitelisted in this sub for their supposed integrity, yet there has been no uptake of the information that counters those allegations. It is hard to imagine that these facts are coincidental. It's also hard to imagine that this case is unique. This is just one example, but the point is this: crypto is founded on principles of decentralization and trustlessness, yet information about crypto continues to be highly manipulated. Metaphorically speaking, the distribution of CryptoInformationCoin is skewed toward a few whales. So please--remain skeptical as you interact in this space. Don't let the truth become just another pump-and-dump."

All it takes is 1 fucker hacking the play store, writing in a trigger in the software made by the government, or some other form of affecting millions of clients. A large enough blockchain can't be reasonably hacked, but blockchain clients will always be a weak link. Theres also the issue of coercion. Coercion isnt possivle in a private booth, but with mobile voting, someone can hold a gun to your head and order you to vote for their candidate. For pencil and paper, rigging an election takes a conspiracy on a massive scale, since the U.S. Presidential Election is actually 52 separate elections (1 in each state, 1 in D.C., and the Electoral College), with thousands of people fudging numbers. With that, there is the fact that you would actually need to handle this election pretty differently due to the electoral college. Oh, also, the electoral college doesn't have to vote the sane way as you, so good luck with that, and did I mention scammers? Yeah, some asshole is going to be calling people and demanding their private keys for \"voter verification\" or something, and a lot of people fall for scams. Think of what might happen if a scammer got ahold of millions of keys that could be used to influence an election. There is also the problem of getting a key for every citizen over 18 in the U.S. Most people arent CS professionals, and, without an understanding of blockchain, will probably fuck up with their keys. There is also the issue that there is a non-zero chance that asymmetric cryptography, which cryptocurrency relies on to be secure, is completely broken, since we have no proof of P vs. NP.

You offer me a bribe of $0.2 if I vote B: if I vote A and A wins, I have $1,100 if I vote A and B wins, I have $1,000 if I vote B and A wins, I have $1,100.2 if I vote B and B wins, I have $1,000.2 Correct so far? At first it may indeed look like always voting B is reasonable. Then I think about it more closely as a voter. Before your offer I wanted A to win to have $1,100. The incentive for me was that if I give my vote to A I increase the chance of A winning. The number of votes is limited. With your offer, if I give my vote to B I'm not giving it to A. I am _not increasing_ the chance of A to win. Also, in some counting methods if I vote B I further _decrease_ the chance of A winning. Why would I reduce my chance of getting +$100 for $0.2? I deliberately kept social effects out of the equation. Now adding them back, Why would I trust a rando offering me a bribe? You'll need to earn my trust. At the very minimum, if I am corruptable, I need to be sure you won't cheat and truly give me the bribe. If I am not corruptable, I will work against your effort. There is an incentive for me to notify my peer voters about your bribe campaign ASAP in order to coordinate and increase the chance of A winning. If the network will not vote the purely beneficial A _because_ of a massive bribery of voters, and if this becomes known, there will be a scandal and my holding may go from $1000 to $500. If my funds are time-locked I won't be able to sell them quick. The more voters you bribe, the higher is the chance some of them will leak the info."

  "reddit": "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Correlation does not imply causation. Trivial logical fallacies aside, your argument is that by putting everyone under surveillance all the time, crime will drop. Fine, I can't argue with that. Let's not even ask ourselves who gets to define what a crime is - smoking vegetation? Being homosexual ? Worshiping a different religion? Buying certain books ? All crimes at times and places in the past. Since you seem to think that we live here and now in the epitome of civilization, where are our laws are just right, what is defined as a crime is what must be defined as a crime, and everything else is right and moral, let me ask you this. To be consistent with your argument that \"total surveillance leads to a crime-free world\", must you also not agree to the following? - Parents of young children could be engaged in pedophilic activities. For a crime-free world, and to protect the children, should all parents be automatically suspected of wrongdoing and put under extensive surveillance in order to make sure a crime is not taking place? - Millions of people read millions of books. Certain books, authorities over the eons demonstrably show, are too dangerous for the common man to read. In order to prevent crime from ideas learned from books, must we not keep track of who purchases which books ? - Anyone anywhere could right not be associating with the \"wrong kind of person\" (a criminal). For a completely crime-free world, must we not track everyone's location, chat history, and map their social networks to preempt crime from happening in the first place? I'm not too sure about version of the world you seem to support. There is good reason free societies have strong separation of powers in government, and there is good reason why before we lost our collective reason over exaggerated terrorist threats there were strong protections in favor of the citizen. That reason is simple: Government repeatedly abuses its power. History shows this very clearly. So be careful what kind of world you wish for. Perfect enforcement of arbitrary laws is very likely to prevent your utopian society from ever progressing. Recent example? The excellent work 30+ by Rick Doblin of maps.org in favor of legalizing MDMA as a therapeutic drug. As anyone who's ever taken MDMA can easily attest to, it is a miracle drug with profound effects on human consciousness that catalyze a deep state of bliss and connection to self and others. Millions and millions of people have been prevented from discovering this because of draconian laws and a sneaky emergency scheduling by the US DEA in 1984 (or was it 1986? doesn't really matter). The gravity of this is only apparent to someone who has taken the drug, and who does recognize it's immense potential. Listen to the Peter Attia Drive podcast episode #65 with Rick Doblin if you are unfamiliar with the topic. Heck, even if you are. That is exactly the sort of thing that would never happen in your utopian description of society, because the core would have long ago become so calcified by perfect enforcement of unjust and imperfect laws that no progress forward could ever have been made."

  "reddit": "1 The majority of well-known cryptocurrency founders have criminal records and extreme views, many others are anonymous. They have preyed on retail investors to enrich themselves and encourage retail investors to promote extremist political views. 2 The founder of bitcoin was anonymous. What if that means he was an employee of a rogue regime, or a programmer for a terrorist group, or had a long list of criminal records? He or they would be amassing a fortune based on the fact that they had a head start in acquiring a large amount of cryptocurrency before the public had a chance. 3 A large majority of the cryptocurrency supply is owned by a small number of wallets with no known ownership. They could be a rogue regime, a terrorist group, child traffickers, a cartel, or all the above. In fact, we have quite a lot of evidence that the ‘all the above’ option is correct. 4 Cryptocurrencies do not meet the definition of money, they function more like shareholding in a network that derives revenue and profit from speculation, money laundering, terrorist financing, drug sales, child sex trafficking, ransomware, bribery, and financial fraud on exchanges. 5 The market prices are clearly artificially boosted with unbacked Tether (a token that is alleged to be backed by US dollars but is unaudited), fake volume and encourages investors to gamble with credit. This means the game is rigged to create Minsky Moments at regular intervals, roughly every 12-15 months, which wipes out retail investors and concentrates more wealth into fewer hands. 6 A portion of every bitcoin transaction goes into the pockets of the Chinese regime who control most of the hash power in cryptocurrency mining. Retail investors outside China should not be paying a transaction tax to that regime. It is also highly likely that mining company Bitmain and cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance are fronts for fund raising for the Chinese regime, its authoritarian figures, and its electronic warfare departments. 7 Reporters such as the website Bellingcat have shown us wallets belonging to known terrorists, Neo-Nazis and Russian intelligence. Retail investors should not be making these parties wealthier. We should not be financing those who kill and oppress people. 8 All the cryptos put together added two whole countries worth of carbon footprint to the planet in the last decade and rising. We are hitting record temperatures and this level of global warming is a threat to us all. This must not be encouraged. Our legacy financial system is much more energy efficient and improving at a much faster rate. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies make them inherently inefficient, slower and power hungry."

Today it is not important if BTC does not have a use case, if it is slow, expensive, energy inefficient and so on. LN is not understood by the market and is not used but it does not matter. Perhaps if the world economy goes into recession in the coming months, people will be willing to do anything to buy BTC and, even if it's slow, expensive and inefficient, even more people will want BTC. But be careful because the BTC ecosystem grows very slowly, it is now a closed mouse closed in exchanges, while the ecosystem of many other cryptocurrencies is growing very rapidly. Markets go through financial cycles, nobody knows when we will enter the next financial cycle but some cryptocurrencies, the most promising, will grow enormously in the future. Nano, thanks to its simplicity and efficiency, will most likely be the cryptocurrency that will multiply its value the most, it will become viral among people, but it is still early ... No one can say if at these prices the best investment is Nano or BTC. Perhaps in the next 12 months BTC will be able to do x2, maybe Nano will be able to do x20, nobody can say it or say otherwise."

The Ledger stores your private key on the device (called cold storage) so it's inaccessible to anyone and therefore can't be stolen. Also, you need to physically have the Ledger to manage coins under that wallet. When you send crypto managed by the Ledger, you'll need to confirm the transaction on the device by pressing a button. This means that someone in North Korea can't steal your funds. The only caveat here is that you must not store the seed words on any electronic device. If someone were to obtain the 24 backup words for your Ledger, they could activate another Ledger with your entire wallet. So, write the words down on a piece of paper and keep it in a safe or bury it somewhere, never save them electronically. Hope this is clear."

I bet you are happy to pay for mobile internet, you even pay for it by the mb. But those mb werent created. There was no energy wasting that went into creating the bandwidth you use. Xrp is like tcp/ip of the internet. It is the bandwidth on which value transfer is happening. Ripple created a product that financial institutions are using. Their product has value based on the problem it solves. The bitcoin that miners create and dump on the market inflates the supply and suppresses bitcoin value. Plain and simple. And they continue doing it every day. Day in and day out. Any amount (which is minuscule) of xrp ripple donated had zero effect on the value of xrp."

Moreover, the amount of risk associated with holding such large sums of tokens is not affordable to many in the What’s even worse is that due to exchange’s forced rules of low hard caps, the amount of users that are able to win access to an IEO is often startlingly low.

You came out of left field and said that something can't be used as a store of value until it has utility. I then explained that we do have utility. We're the only blockchain that has any real world utility. And I'm not talking about exchange volume. I'm talking about real on-chain Bitcoin transactions. You're using circular logic No I'm not.

If that were to be defined as main usecase I can see slowness of transaction not sinking the ship. It all depends on how often you need to reach to your vault if that becomes the main point of Bitcoin. Would you open it everyday, once a week, once a month, once a quarter?

When considering selling a position you should basically analyse if this stock is the best to hold or if another stock has greater earning potential. If you could have made $100 holding a stock and instead lose $50 on a different stock the decision to change position has caused you to lose $150.

Since it wasn't so busy, I talked to her a bit about the stuff and it wasn't long until she started talking about Plus Token. It's just so much better than traditional banks! I put my funds there and I get 8% of interest each month! It's just so amazing! She was really enthusiastic about it and I just went \"I'd always be careful, there's a lot of scams in the field\" etc but she was going like it's soooo huge in Korea, everyone over there is using it and you just have to stake or whatever, I looked it up back home but information was scarce and it just seemed super fishy overall.

Blockstream does have other products such as liquid which is a federated sidechain controlled by 12 exchanges. This theoretically can give them profit through the fees on the transactions.

While you seem to think i have blinders on, in reality it is you who has allowed your predetermined belief to cloud your judgement. The only, plain and simple fact that matters: THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT THE SEC IS PURSUING RIPPLE. Which is the ONLY indication that XRP would be deemed a security. And, even IF the SEC DID pursue ripple, that STIL does not guarantee that xrp would be found a security, because that would be the result of a court ruling in favor of the SEC.

Bitcoin is the first and the largest crypto so it makes sense why you stick with it. Even though it is out of your realm of interest, I suggest you you look into some other crypto subreddits and see the discussions going on there. Nano on the other hand is consistently in the top 50 and is currently worth about $130m. It might not have the highest dollar value of some of the cryptocurrencies. What it does have is a (amazing) working product that does exactly what it claims to do. It has a large and active community surround it. It has a small development team so it is not wasting resources. Its development is also supplemented by the hard work of the community.

It may be a \"block-chain\" but it lacks the ethos of what drove the invention of such a concept in the first place. Likewise, who is going to be auditing this Walmart USD-pegged coin? We should all know how that's working with Tether. DApps are valuable but no one knows yet on how to reasonably capitalize on that value and putting everything on the main chain essentially means as the value and usage of that chain goes up, so does the cost of using the DApp. Again this is why we desired to create side-chains that allow you the best of both these worlds.

  "reddit": "Fair enough, but most of those would still apply. Or rather, as Kappture demonstrated with their Nano demo, at the bare minimum you would need to tap for NFC and then wait for confirmation. Perhaps you would also need to enter a PIN, but I'm thinking under €25 there might be an option in phone wallets to not require this. With Nano, having just the NFC tap and then wait for confirmation takes 1 second from the Nano protocol side, could still be 3 seconds for the machine to process it of course. Still though, that would be 4 seconds. With Ethereum it's be 15 seconds for the confirmation, then the same 3 seconds for the machine to process. There's a world of difference between 4 seconds and 18 seconds when you're waiting in line. As for in store transactions taking a long time, that's not true where I live. I can tap and go, doesn't take more than 5 seconds in total. Granted, this is for small transactions where no PIN is necessary."

Just use a cryptocurrency credit card then. Also, as a store owner, would you be ok in your customers tracing your money and figuring out how much you make and own? How could this be done? Unless 100% of your money is coming from cryptocurrency. Even then there are services that change the receiving address, so that can't happen.

That includes the coins with features/gimmicks. There is no demand for 99% of these cryptocurrencies - they are solutions looking for problems. No cryptocurrency is immune from crass manipulation by a handful of individuals, and this is the only thing that explains the ups and downs. Anybody not in that small group of heavy investors is engaging in gambling without knowing the odds. Well-worn memes like \"BTFD\" and \"alt season\" are reflex responses that derail critical detailed discussions. every single day is another cycle of speculation; repackaging the same, low-information buzzphrases year-after-year. I've also noticed in subreddits devoted to specific cryptocurrencies, almost any post pointing out failures or deficiencies of the coin will be downvoted into oblivion. it makes it difficult to get anything but hype from most cryptocurrency subreddits. Becuase you never know who is a shitcoin bagholder, I've found you can never trust anybody's advice up front because almost everybody will have conflicts of interest in the range of hundreds, to hundreds of thousands of dollars. the greater fool theory is strong in these speculative subreddits. The investors i most pay attention to are the people that are in it for the long haul. not the hackneyed 'hodlers', but people that are investing long term, measured in decades, and diversified in both retail, fiat investments, and a small percentage in cryptocurrency. To me, the fundamentals are key, and that includes managing risks in all asset classes, especially the incoherent, short-term cryptocurrency markets vulnerable to manipulation."

To determine the value of gold as an end product you would have to remove all those people. Real estate is an even clearer example of speculation! It is a market built on artificial scarcity! The majority of value in a property comes from location, not for the actual product being built (the building) and that value is driven by a low supply. Nothing else! When people \"invest for the long term\" they are looking for financial growth - or at the very least, security - which is just another way of saying \"I speculate that the price of this product will stay the same or rise over x amount of years\". It says nothing about the usefulness of any of the instruments in play. The only reason most people need to \"invest for the future\" in the first place is because of inflation, and the fact that wages generally don't rise in proportion with inflation."

Let's say the dollar value of Ether doubles during that time. Your $67 worth of ETH that you got from borrowing is now worth $134. You convert enough of it back to DAI to pay back your loan. At a high 20% interest rate, you'll have to pay back around $80 worth of DAI to the lender. The rest you can keep. Your collateral ETH doubled in price as well and is now worth $200. With the additional $54 (134-80) worth of ETH, you now have a total value of $254. Congratulations, instead of increasing your holdings by 100% due to ETH doubling in price, you increased it by 154%."

  "reddit": "I wrote a long comment somewhere in this thread about how merchants currently lose 2-5% on all transactions to credit card fees. If crypto provides alternative payment rails that cost merchants 1% (from payment processor fees and slippage converting from crypto to fiat), that represents a gigantic savings opportunity for merchants. Most grocery chains have 2% profit margins. Saving them 1% on credit card fees represents a 50% increase in profitability In theory these savings would eventually be passed on to consumers. The point is that the current system charges every transaction on earth a significant fee, in order to support the business models of credit cards and banks. Crypto represents an opportunity to shrink the cost of transactions massively, by disintermediating all these transactions"

  "reddit": "After seeing the post earlier today about the leaked chat between Franklyn and Charlie Lee about lack of development, I made a video about it for my subs. Many Litecoin fans do not believe that it is legit. But if you guys go into the Litecoin telegram page (@litecoin), you'll see that people asked Charlie about my video and he confirms that the chat did happen and that development was slow and no one is stepping up to help work on it. Here is a screenshot for reference. It's disappointing about the transparency and Franklyn (if he is still foundation director) and Charlie is probably going to have to answer a lot of hard questions to answer during Litecoin summit. I do agree that adoption is important and that marketing helps people become aware of LTC. However, I don't think Dolphin fans sitting in the stadium seeing LTC ads is the answer. Charlie says there is no help, couldn't the sponsorship money be used to hire some kick-ass developers? Charlie won't respond to my messages and have kicked me out of the Litecoin Chat permanently unfortunately."

In the morning, the CEO of Polo Multimodal Sebastiano Di Ruocco and COO Victor Ghia welcomed Mr. Ling at the headquarters in Fortaleza to expose the project of the first Smart Chain City in Latin America: the Polo Multimodal Pecém. An agreement was signed between Waltonchain and Polo Multimodal linking the new partnership, where Waltonchain attests that it will provide technologies to implement the Polo Multimodal project. As an example, the implementation of the Polo Coin will be provided by Waltonchain's child chain. Waltonchain uses the RFID technology to promote the blockchain from the Internet to the Internet of Things (IoT) to realize the concept of Value Internet of Things to create an authentic, traceable business and fully shared model, completely transparent. More specifically, the contributions of this partnership with Waltonchain to the Polo Multimodal are: build a platform for Smart Chain City, provide IoT and smart container devices, customize APPs and the PoloCoin wallet -create a community of operation of the Polo Multimodal in Asia. In the afternoon Di Ruocco and Ghia drove Ling to São Gonçalo do Amarante to visit the site where the first Smart Chain City in Latin America will be implemented. The proximity of the land to the capital of Ceará provided the full field recognition of the area. The credibility of the partnership with Waltonchain, already firm in the market, will bring the implementation of digital life safely in Polo Multimodal Pecém.

  "reddit": "To the people who say this as an argument against Bitcoin, you are very wrong. Do you honestly think people will pay for their shopping via wallet to wallet transactions? No! They'll use Bitcoin banks, merchants will hold their BTC in banks that insure and protect their funds, and the general public will have to use these banks to use BTC because it'll be the only way they know how. Simply put, every transaction made from Bitcoin bank A to Bitcoin bank B will be merged into one transaction on the blockchain. One transaction, one fee, millions of purchases. Use the same Bitcoin bank as the merchant you're buying from? The transaction will be stored on the banks internal ledger, no transaction needs to be put on the blockchain and no fees need paying. Bitcoin banks will guarantee your payments instantly and the transaction confirmed in 10 minutes instead of 3 to 5 days, and a single transaction fee will be split between potentially millions of people. It's a hell of a lot faster and cheaper than a credit card."

Some predicted that eventually Bitcoin dominance will average around 40 % in the long run. Someone told me that the only reason alts took off at that time was because Eth was needed to get into the alts and now it's not necessary so it will never bounce back to capturing 60% of the market like before. At the same time, though Btc dominates now, alts usually seem to follow a bit later. What are some arguments alts will or won't bounce back?"

  "reddit": "This post is just to share my thoughts. I have been invested in crypto since early 2017. Currently I am seeing similar euphoria with BTC in the community/news that occurred as btc hit 19k and then 17k in 2017. E.g., Cnbc saying btc is a safe haven. One thing I've learned is that markets tend to do the opposite of what everyone expects. It has happened countless times with BTC. No one expected BTC to break below 6k and back above 6k. No one expected 3k to be bottom. No one expected 19k/17k to be the top. No one expects 14k and now 12k to be the local top. To be clear I would love for BTC to continue its rise up and believe in its use case long term. That being said, BTC has taught me to always be wary to what everyone is thinking will happen. Specifically, if everyone is thinking one way, chances are the market will move the other way. Does that mean I am suggesting this is the local top? No. However, I am suggesting to at least consider it. TLDR: The point of this post is simply to consider alternate views from the majority. Edit: This is what I'm referring to when I say 'everyone thinking one way versus the other':"

  "reddit": "Bitcoin Royale is a protocol based on Bitcoin focused on a specific goal - designing the best store of value and addressing the problem of theft. GitHub project: https://github.com/bitcoinroyale Design paper: https://bitcoinroyale.github.io/bitcoinroyale.pdf Some overview: Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision for Bitcoin was to create a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash. The majority of successful forks of the protocol try to improve on this vision further and provide a more scalable and efficient system for payments. We see Bitcoin's greatest promise not as a medium of exchange but as a store of value - a better form of gold, not cash. We propose a set of modifications to the original protocol aimed at fulfilling this promise by creating the ultimate electronic store of value. By increasing Bitcoin's effective transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes to 24 hours, we are able to tackle Bitcoin's greatest flaw as a form of gold - susceptibility to theft. A system geared less towards paying for coffee and more towards holding one's life savings with complete peace of mind, where every transaction is alerted on-chain for 144 blocks and can be canceled on emergency with a recovery key that was never used prior and hence invulnerable. The bootstrap of this system is not via hard fork but through a fairer mechanism of expedited mining, allowing the system to catch up to Bitcoin in a short period of time. Here is how you can help: For constructive feedback on the design, open an issue for discussion here: https://github.com/bitcoinroyale/whitepaper This is an open community project, whether you want to code or run a node, please become a contributor on github. If you want to run the very first nodes and participate in the genesis - please open an issue on github. Thanks for your support, Ian"

  "reddit": "When looking at stocks, there are models that gives a valuation. This valuation depends on the current and future expectation of the company. It is the dividends that gives this connection. Companies that don't use dividends use buy-backs of stocks instead, which is effectively the same thing. Cryptocurrencies don't have dividends. Because of that, the connection between the success of the underlying blockchain and the coin valuation is much weaker. It isn't just weak, there are no good models. What most people fail to understand is that the value of a blockchain is disconnected from the value of the coins. Sometimes, there is a reference to the \"intrinsic value\", which is vague. I prefer to use the \"utility\". Most blockchains have utilities, even if is hard to compute what the actual value of these are. As the connection is weak, and there isn't any monetary policy that controls the value, it is up to other market forces. I think the market frequently is controlled by people looking for maximal profits as well as pure manipulation, not concerned with the actual utilities of the blockchain."

  "reddit": "Introduction: Cryptocurrencies are a perfect means of storing value as well as sending and receiving money across borders. And, following the narrative spawn since their inception, you probably assume that they are also anonymous, right? Well, cryptocurrencies are, unfortunately, not anonymous. Maybe pseudonymous! The wallet that stores your cryptocurrencies is identifiable using the public key attached to it. And though this identifier does not necessarily lead to your other personal details, the information is still decipherable via the blockchain. Here are contextual examples: Sending money – When you send money to an acquaintance, the recipient can easily connect you to your wallet, check every incoming and outgoing transaction, and the balance left in the wallet. Purchasing goods online – Every time you buy goods online, you are prompted to provide an address so that the vendor can deliver the goods to your doorstep. If you use cryptocurrencies during the purchase, the merchant can link your identity and private information to your private wallet. Our Vision: The examples above are only two of the possibly hundreds of other use cases that leave you vulnerable and exposed after transacting in crypto. The coins, after all, are not as anonymous as enthusiasts would want you to believe. By now you are probably wondering if there are alternatives that do not leave you out in the public, and naked! Is it even possible to use and transfer crypto and at the same time, keep this information, including your wallet balance from friends and the public?

Using SmartMixer is wholly anonymous. Wholly Customizable – The platform can work out any transactions sets as you prefer giving you an opportunity to custom set the service fee in thousandth of a percent.

Easy to Use – We prioritize online customer experience; as such, we have developed a platform that is easy to understand and use. FAQs: FAQ 1 – How does it work? Smartmixer has different types of mixing strategies as defined by the pools below. Standard Pool: Traditional and offers the basic type of mixing, where we mix your funds with incoming funds from other clients. Smart Pool: This pool uses three different sources of coins to cleanse your coins. We use parts of huge mixing amounts of the Standard Pool, private reserves of Smartmixer and funds from investors. Stealth Pool: The Stealth Pool isn't related in any way to coins of the Standard Pool. Instead, it relies only on reserves of Smartmixer and Coins from Investors. It is the safest method to mix your coins. FAQ 2 – How anonymous am I when using Smartmixer? Smartmixer afford you complete anonymity. The platform does not keep logs or user information such as deposit and withdrawal addresses permanently. Instead, this information resides in the servers only for as long as is technically necessary for the purposes of completing a transaction. All status pages are deleted alongside the transaction logs not more than 24 hours after a mixing operation. Alternatively, the user can delete this information soon after a transaction. FAQ 3 – How can you avoid a return of same coins when no data is saved? As mentioned, we do not save any data in our database, such as deposit and withdrawal addresses or transactions. Such information is only used as long as is technically necessary to complete a transaction and is automatically deleted after. To ensure that our users do not receive the same coins they have mixed earlier, Smartmixer uses a One-Way-Encryption process with hashing operations. Different parameters will be utilized in order to calculate the hashes. The result of the one-way-encryption algorithm will be assigned to the smart code and cannot be deduced from our deposit address. Therefore, the smart code should be entered before each mixing operation. Additionally, we assign our users one of several pools for each transaction. So, whenever the user has been already assigned a specific Pool for a transaction, he or she will receive withdrawals only from other pools of the same category that are managed internally in our system. Thus, we guarantee the highest security in just two steps and without loss of anonymity. Our users never receive the same coins mixed before with our service.

Money that before where getting moved from alts to BTC are now getting moved back into alts while common people like us are selling their beloved shitcoins out of despair waiting with cash on the sideline to buy BTC. So we have big hands selling Bitcoin for alts, small investors selling their alts into Fiat waiting to buy BTC. This is why in my opinion the market it's not moving or moving slightly lower, once the rebalance it's complete we are ready for a short but intense alt season. Meanwhile we will have some long leveraged positions getting liquidated, so don't get surprised if we see some big movements to the downside for short periods of time. This is my view, not a financial advice, personally I'm keeping my alts :)"

  "reddit": "BAT (brave browser token) is seriously slept on, hear me out. 1. Brave is the most popular crypto application, gaining serious traction lately, these numbers are impressive: 2. In many ways, a browser can and in most cases are an entry point to the internet, its not unreasonable to think that a browser could position itself as the entry point to crypto for millions of users. 3. There are many advantages of being the entry point for a huge chunk of users, for example, how does a wallet addon survive if Brave creates its own native noncustodial wallet? How about a Dex.. The list goes on. The guy who controls the entry point has a lot of power. No one is positioned better than Brave in that regard. 4. The BAT token is slowly being integrated all over, no other similar token is even close. Once they reach a certain level of adoption it will be extremely difficult for anyone to compete. Similarly to how social media platforms have a lock on their segment, the users themselves become a huge incentive and growth driver. 5. Brave browser has a truly revolutionary element to it, users can earn real money by allowing ads. Not only that users can choose to donate/reward their favorite content creators directly, either auto or manually. No one else does it, the closest anyone has ever come to something similar is rewarding a few % worth of coupons. 6. Brave users can earn serious money, you can earn more by browsing the web than what the poorest 1billion of people on earth earn by working. Think about that for a second. (You would have to exclusively browse brave verified websites, but with so many publishers joining I frequently land on sites that are verified) 7. Brave also has a powerful and honorable mission, to protect user's privacy and remove the status quo with massive privacy-intrusive practices of selling users data. Something that is slowly becoming a mainstream concern. 8. The Bat token has several very healthy mechanics that could see it take off. First of all, every advertiser would have to buy the Bat token to pay for their ads to be displayed. This creates volume and continuous demand. 9. But what many fail to realize is that with BAT there will be a MUCH larger loss of coins than any other crypto, millions of people having various devices where they have earned a few Bat, they lose their phone, forget about the wallet.. They haven't paid for anything, they may not even know it could become valuable. No idea how to estimate the numbers yearly but it has to be a ridiculous amount of tokens that exit circulation. 10. If Brave continues to grow, BAT could take on new lifeforms. It would be the cryptocurrency most people have available at their fingertips. It would make sense for all sorts of merchants to start accepting it. Especially those merchants that sell inexpensive services such as VPN, domains, streaming and so forth. Brave could also incorporate scheduled billing easily, ability to swap to/from other tokens, lend out Bat, Loan Bat, all defi. 11. Brave might become one of the most important entry points as outlined above, that would give huge incentives for other projects to accommodate and cater to BAT holders, similarly to how Binance, for example, enables airdrops and various incentives given to their costumers Brave could also encourage new partners to create advantages and perks for BAT. 12. BAT protocol is separated from Brave, so other browsers and unaffiliated tech could join the ecosystem and instantly gain value from the already widespread existing use of BAT. Its a genius by Brave to have structured it this way imo, it drastically increases the chances that BAT could become the default \"attention token\". 13. If Bat accomplishes its goal, it will see a Bitcoin-like growth in value, in fact, it could bc of its unique positioning/angle overtake and become more widely used than bitcoin itself. We could also speculate that the BAT wallet ultimately would allow for Bitcoin atomic swaps, enabling users to earn Bitcoins or Eth instead of BAT if they choose. (With a slight penalty or burn I would assume)"

  "reddit": "Cryptocurrency is a payment method, Bitcoin is a huge investment, Blockchain is a revolutionary technology. Regardless of the angle from which many view this new phenomenon, there is a global issue that needs to be addressed, and that’s Blockchain energy consumption. Blockchain is a ledger that verifies, validates and records transactions. The public and permissionless ones have no single central entity and rely on mining using consensus protocols like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm. PoW is the computational effort expended in hashing a transaction on the blockchain, where several computers known as ‘nodes’, already connected to the network, engage in a computational race to solve a transaction code to update and verify the network. While PoS on the other hand, an efficient alternative to Proof of Work, is another algorithm that can be used to approve transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. While it has its own set of limitations and problems, energy use is not one of them. Now, trying to identify the global energy issue related to Bitcoin mining, it’s time to point out the threats it poses. In a literal sense, Bitcoin is power hungry. And everyone knows that energy issues ultimately affect the climate. One question that fearfully comes to mind is, “with the rate of this consumption, is the sustainability of blockchain assured?” With every government focused on reducing carbon footprint, if this keeps on going it could mean unnecessarily harsh regulations for the crypto industry. First of all, is this even a problem that everyone MUST solve? After all, electricity is required to produce anyone's toast, make elevators move and, of course, let anyone read this article entitled \"\". With regards as to what's stated on it, it is no secret that Proof-of-Work is not the only best way to take advantage of blockchain; as leaders in the industry are actively looking for a replacement. Likely as mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptos accelerates, increased energy consumption is a given. With that maybe, the above-recommended solutions are worth considering by the community."

As a result, nodes are hosted using a VPS like AWS () or DigitalOcean (). Also as a result, the tax implications are far better in most jurisdictions, there are unlikely to be any legal issues for Americans, and the roles of the node-runners cannot be eliminated in the future to save costs (without the nodes there is no functional network). Approximate monthly hosting costs are $15/node. Compare that to the monthly returns you can make on the unofficial community calculator . Even with the current low bundle number, everything is profitable other than the poverty zeta node. Support for setting up nodes is readily available on the relevant Telegram or Slack channel.

This is not financial advice or anything - but something to be happy as this was almost never seen except at $3K levels last December.

  "reddit": "Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awt-5PE0hLk My notes are below. Overview - Founded in 2014 - Main idea was to use Bitcoin for the payment use case - They are bridging the gap between current infrastructure and a full crypto-to-crypto world by offering products that use the current infrastructure (e.g. VISA) with crypto on the backend - Payment use cases include cross-border, daily commerce, and machine-to-machine - Currently have around 100 employees, 2.5 million customers, and 5,000 corporate customers - Most of their active customers are in Europe - Licensed and regulated in the UK - backed by Softbank/SBI Group - Have offices all over the world, which show where they plan to expand (Tokyo, Singapore, Atlanta, London, Toronto, etc) Company Products and Features - Their products are split by corporate and consumer - They offer multi-currency accounts that support multiple in/out funds (ACH, SWIFT, debit/credit, etc) - Instant exchange - fiat-to-crypto, crypto-to-crypto, and crypto-to-fiat - OTC rates for customers - Wirex is integrated with multiple exchanges and offers those OTC rates directly to their customers. This keeps fees low and liqudity high - VISA card so funds can be used everywhere - \"Cryptoback\" - Cashback but for cryptocurrencies - Supports 26 currencies, including multiple fiat currencies - Freemium pricing volume for corporate accounts - Low volume is free, you can pay a subscription fee if you need higher limits - Fully automated KYB - Much faster onboarding than traditional banks (days vs weeks) Other Thoughts - Full merchant adoption will take time - Lot of legacy systems that won't disappear anytime soon - P2P payments and the token economy are coming fast, and Wirex is bridging the gap - They see a lot of people that aren't familiar with cryptocurrencies using their card because of the rewards (cashback/cryptoback) - Nano is one of Wirex's top currencies (9:50) - It was very difficult to open cryptocurrency-related accounts in multiple currencies, but now that they've gone through that process they can offer similar accounts to corporate customers - They launched their corporate account product a few months ago and in the first week they had 5,000 crypto business applicants without any marketing Roadmap - Asia and North America launches are planned for 2019 - cards are actively being tested right now - India, Latin America, and Africa launches planned for 2020 - Planning to open offices in Mexico and Brazil - REST API coming soon so businesses can directly integrate to Wirex's infrastructure - Doubling their client-base every year - 5 million planned for 2019, goal is 25 million by 2021 - Planning to launch 26 Stellar-based stablecoins + IBM World Wire integration. 2019 - A multi-currency card is planned QA - Why was Wirex successful getting debit cards when other companies have failed? Wirex built working products, not just promises. They've got the backing to obtain the necessary licenses - Are there any plans to fix Wirex's Nano implementation (hot-wallet keeps going down)? This shouldn't be happening, Pavel will follow-up with his team. - Where will Nano be incorporated in the future? Possibly in the cryptoback product - What is the average conversion fee between fiat and crypto? There is no flat fee - fees depend on the currency path (more liquid currencies have lower fees). - What do you plan to integrate with machine-to-machine payments? Hard to say since machine-to-machine is still in the vision phase.

  "reddit": "tl;dr - Bitcoin wins July, Bitcoin leading overall, Bitcoin has six month streak of month end gains intact, Bitcoin approaching break even point. Total -75% return for Top Ten of 2018 plus total +74% return for (where Litecoin has performed the best) means I've basically broken even after 19 months of the running the experiment. The Experiment: Instead of hypothetically tracking cryptos, I made an actual $1000 investment, $100 in each of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap as of the 1st of January 2018. Think of it as a lazy man's Index Fund (no weighting or rebalancing), less technical, more fun (for me at least), and hopefully still a proxy for the market as a whole - or at the very least an interesting snapshot of the 2018/2019 crypto space. I’m trying to keep it simple and accessible for beginners and those looking to get into crypto but maybe not quite ready to jump in yet. I have also started a on January 1st, 2019, I repeated the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) into the new Top Ten cryptos as of January 1st 2019. Spoiler alert: I'm down on the 2018 Experiment as much as I'm up on the 2019 Experiment, so I've basically broken even between the two experiments at this point. The Rules: Buy $100 of each the Top 10 cryptocurrencies on January 1st, 2018. Run the experiment two years. Hold only. No selling. No trading. Report monthly. Month Nineteen - Down 75% https://i.redd.it/0clvimd6q1f31.png July certainly felt like a bloodbath (look at all of that red), but by month's end, the 2018 Top Ten were only down about 4% on the month, which is nothing for crypto. Although modest, this decline signals the end of the five month upward streak that had been in place from February to June. Ranking https://i.redd.it/dewhwrn8q1f31.png Lots of movement again in July, and again most of it downward. After briefly revisiting the Top Ten, Cardano gave up its position and then some, sliding all the way back to position #13. NEM continued its slow and steady fall now at #23 and IOTA, at #19, is now in real danger of falling out of the Top Twenty. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash switched places with each other (again) and Stellar reclaimed its spot in the Top Ten, rising two slots from #12 to #10. NEM, Dash, IOTA, and Cardano are the 2018 Top Ten dropouts - they have been replaced by EOS, Binance Coin, Tether, and BTCSV. July Winners \\- Bitcoin was the only crypto to finish the month in positive territory, up +6%. July Losers \\- Cardano lost -33% of its value and dropped three spots in the rankings. Tough month for ADA to say the least. Tough month for Dash too, down -31% in July. For those keeping score, here is tally of which coins have the most monthly wins and loses during the first 19 months of this experiment. Most monthly wins (4): Bitcoin. Most monthly loses (5): Stellar. All cryptos have at least one monthly win. The only two coins never to lose a month? Bitcoin and Dash. https://i.redd.it/63ot9tr9q1f31.png Overall update – No cyrpto close to Bitcoin as it inches closer to break-even point. NEM, Cardano, and IOTA in the cellar. Bitcoin followed up a strong May and June with a solid +6% July. It is now down -11% since January 2018 and is approaching the break-even point. Litecoin is a very distant second at -56% since the experiment began. NEM is still the worst overall performer (down -93%) followed by IOTA and ADA both down -92%. My initial $100 investment in NEM is worth just $7.04. Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector: https://i.redd.it/sgwl0ozbq1f31.png For the first time since February, the total crypto market cap decreased, losing about $13B in July. The overall market cap remains over $300B and overall the 2018 Top Ten experiment has crossed the -50% threshold and is down \"only\" -46% at the moment, a level we haven't seen since June 2018. Bitcoin dominance: https://i.redd.it/oed4908dq1f31.png Bitcoin dominance saw another large leap in July and now stands at almost 68%, easily the highest point so far in the experiment began in January 2018. Overall return on investment from January 1st, 2018: https://i.redd.it/nervgyxfq1f31.png My Top Ten 2018 portfolio lost about $50 in total value this month. This decrease broke the five month streak of increasing total value, which was a record in the experiment. If I cashed out today, my $1000 initial investment would return about $249, down -75%. Implications/Observations: In contrast to the where Litecoin is the top performer of the year, it's all BTC with the Top Ten 2018 Experiment. Altcoins again lost ground against Bitcoin which now represents over 2/3rds of the value entire crypto market. Although the 2018 Top Ten's streak of five consecutive positive months was broken, BTC's streak is now up to six straight months of growth. Once again this month marks a record high in Bitcoin dominance, 68%, the highest since the experiment started in January 2018. And Bitcoin continues to increase its overall lead. After nineteen months, it is now 45% ahead of second place Litecoin in terms of return on initial investment. The experiment's focus of solely holding the Top Ten Cryptos continues to be a losing approach. While the overall market is down -46% from January 2018, the cryptos that began 2018 in the Top Ten are down -75% over the same period. That's close to a 30% difference, the widest gap of the experiment so far. At no point has this investment strategy worked: the initial 2018 Top Ten have under-performed each of the nineteen months compared to the market overall. I'm also tracking the SP 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The SP 500 is now up +9.7% since the beginning of 2018. My initial $1k investment into crypto would have yielded about +$97 had it been redirected to the SP. https://i.redd.it/nazjtf0hq1f31.png Conclusion: Even a down month for crypto couldn't stop Bitcoin, which has seen six straight months end with gains. How much higher can it go in terms of dominance and when will we see the alts make a move? Thanks for reading and for supporting the experiment. I hope you’ve found it helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports. Keep an eye out for my where I repeated the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of a new set of Top Ten cryptos as of January 1st 2019."

  "reddit": "Every day new exchange appears, each of them presents a BRAND NEW REFERRAL PROGRAM(which can be quite similar to an MLM scheme), SUPER LOW FEE's, and other doubtful stuff. But if we look at them under a magnifying glass, we will see that mostly they are copy-pasted versions of ones from other huge exchanges. Why do people trust them? It appears to me that greed and unwillingness to do their own research lead them right in the hands of fraudsters. These exchanges could take control of users funds and disappear, we've seen this happen more than once(basically if you Google “crypto exchange scam” you will find a lot of related materials), it's possible because of the teams or individuals behind shit.exchange's don’t reveal themselves, which makes them almost completely invincible to any prosecution. Vitalik Buterin stated that he hopes “centralized exchanges go burn in hell as much as possible”. I totally agree with him this time, so what are the outcomes? Let's think why do we use CEX or DEX - CEX - A centralized exchange. When you are looking at the Centralised exchanges, you want to use them, more frequently because: 1. of the trust and ease of use that is provided by them; In the beginning people were afraid of taking control of their funds, actually human beings biologically always want to transfer their responsibilities to someone else, so they can blame others in case of anything going wrong. Only a small percentage knows how to transfer BTC without a user-friendly wallet interface. So a mass of people deposited everything on exchanges and became victims of different scam schemes (for example Bitfinex case, which is really a very controversial story according to Google him - Bitfinexed). Victims weren't able to withdraw their funds or even got robbed in some cases. I don't understand why people put up with it, how could such scammers collect 1bln during an IEO. 2) or perhaps you need a fiat gateway to cash out some gainings; 3) to trade a uniquely listed token / participate in an event; 4) the greed, a lot of us joined the BNB race, that started from 5$ and ended at 37$, caused by an IEO hype; 5) etc, add your opinion in the comments; DEX - A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer (p2p) online service that allows direct cryptocurrency transactions between two interested parties. \\If we take a glance at the ratio CEXs to DEXs, we will see that 81% belongs to the CEX and only 19% to DEX's. As for trading volume - 99.17% CEX / 0.83% DEX (\\source - cointelegraph, here you can go deeper into the pros and cons.) DEX's usually provide a huge choice of assets to trade, but there is not too much volume and there is a myth, that it's difficult to start trading on them. A New hope - CEX + DEX = HEX It seems there is a new class of crypto exchanges coming, called Hybrid, this approach combines the pros of CEX's and DEX's and cuts off cons by implementing the pros of the opposite. So how do they basically work? Usually, there are 2 parts of the HEX, one that provides you a fiat gateway and asks you to go through KYC(centralized one) and other, that provides you the p2p exchange solution(decentralized), backed by blockchain technology. In most cases, this slows down processing speed, but there are some gems, that solved this issue. Actually, implementing your own blockchain in the exchange's ecosystem may provide additional features, but this is absolutely another thing and quite challenging from a technical perspective. I'm not here to shill any of them, I made a research on the current market state and made my choice. I'm ready to discuss some of the DEX's / HEX's with you guys to strengthen my knowledge and self-confidence. How do you choose the exchange to trade on? Is it Binance or KuCoin or ...?"

To this end, I was wondering if anyone has heard of or thought of interesting functionalities to help this. For example, a lottery-esque function where an incredibly small part of each transaction were put into an inaccessible wallet, and a jackpot distributed between a sender and receiver once a transaction were to generate the same matching random number. This scenario comes with obvious concerns, such as simply hacking the numbers or ensuring there can't be a powerful group of servers from sending transactions to themselves, but I don't think any of them outright stop the idea from consideration. It would seem like an easy sell to be able to say that you could perform the same transaction that you would've normally done anyway, and had the chance to hit a lottery with each of those transactions."

  "reddit": "This is a concept on how to combine 1. cryptocurrency 2. universal basic income (UBI) 3. demurrage tax, into one with only little development needed. It uses a method combining mining and minting into one. For those that have never heard of UBI and demurrage on money, I recommend reading about it elsewhere. It is really hard to explain those concepts, and why you might want them, a short post. Those have been discussed for over hundred years, so I will engage in no argument about if we want them. I assume that we do. As a teenager I started to look for concepts on how to fix the world. For two of those, basic income and demurrage, I realized that they pair very well. UBI is an income that every person receives equally and is high enough to satisfy their basic needs. It's an easy concept and most of the discussion around it revolve about how to finance it. A demurrage is tax on money, a sort of build-in inflation. If you hoard money, you will lose (for example) 10% annually. This is meant to provide an incentive to spend the money and as a way of redistribution. It also allows for interest free loans (you loan 100 and give back 100, saving the lender the demurrage). Naturally, it pairs well to provide the UBI out of the demurrage paid. There then emerges a cutoff point in wealth. Those that are above that cutoff will lose some of their money, those below gain until they reach that level. It's the exact opposite of the current monetary system, where those that are rich become richer, and those that are poor become poorer. Ever since the first cryptocurrency emerged I wondered how to implement those two concepts into a crypto currency. At some point Freicoin was created, which had a demurrage, but failed for several reasons. One of the reasons, I think, is that whenever you have a demurrage, you also have to provide some way of circulation to have it flow back to the people. The most successful experiment with demurrage so far (search: the wonder of Wörgel) had the city pay workers in that currency for public work (which worked well at that time because it was a keynesian approach, where the rest of the world did the opposite). The same money therefor was used several times. It was redistributed, not destroyed. Here now the concept on how to create a cryptocoin to (kind of) create a basic income financed by inflation. Starting by taking a classic cc. We then need to change two things, the inflation (the easy part) and the mining/minting (the harder part). We set a function for the block reward so that we have 10% (or whatever you want) for the annual inflation. This means the block reward increases over time. The mining/minting is replaced by a process that combines both into one new form. This isn't like many other coins where they have both, it's one new process. (Let's call it \"growing\"..) The process of finding a block in classic minting is (simplified) that you can hash once per second and based on how much money you have, your chances of finding a block increase. Growing is similar, with the difference that you can hash as often as you want and also include a factor i into the hash function for every new iteration. The bigger i is, the smaller the chances of finding a block. Naturally on your first try you use i=0 and everything works like in POS. In you second try you use i=1, thereby changing the hash. But this time the value you have to compete against is lower by some factor. So your chances didn't double but might have increased by only a factor of 1.5. This repeats until any further try only increases your chance so minimally that it is not worth wasting the energy for it. Say, for your first try you have a chance of 1, if you want a chance of 2 you would need two additional tries, for 3 you would need 4 tires, for a chance of 4 you would need 8 tries. It becomes exponentially harder. In effect this process lets money \"grow\". It strikes a balance between minting and mining, taking advantages of both. It isn't worth building big mining farms, as it gives you only minimally more profit, but it also isn't just an interest that you gain by hoarding money. What ideally emerges is that people will have the process running on their standard consumer devices, just to even out the inflation with their growing income. For every performance that a device allows you, there is an amount of currency that you can store there. For those that have less than their performance allows, the stored amount will grow. For those that have more than they can store, it diminishes. It's the same equilibrium as mentioned above, those with to little money gain, those with to much lose. The difference is that it depends on you hardware and energy consumption. Some might ask themselves at this point why they should invest into such a coin. Well, you shouldn't. The very idea is that you use it. In the view of Gresham's law \"bad money drives out good money\" this is \"bad\" money. You might initially only use it to tip people on the internet, as a social gift for good work. You can always spend some amount because it just grows back. And with use, it becomes useful over time. While I have been sitting on this idea for some time now. It still is in it's infancy and might have some problems to solve. But at least it is some way to achieve the goal laid out in the beginning."

  "reddit": "When BTC rises, alts get sold almost instantly. The alt prices in fiat tend to stay the same but their prices in USD fall. I assume it's bots doing it because humans don't react that fast - unless I am mistaken. What is the money making strategy in selling alts like this? Is it to gain BTC or USD? Or to cut short losses on alts? I have previously written bots to make BTC and I would do the opposite of what we are seeing in the market. I would sell the alt/fiat pair when BTC goes down and buy them when BTC goes up. Ie buy BTC low and sell high. I don't want to go into too much detail because it changes the subject of the thread. I get the impression that the bots are trying to make fiat with these price movements. So if BTC goes up they sell alts to fiat (usually Tether or stable coins). Their aim is to make USD and not BTC. This way they sell alts high using fiat, and buy them back low using fiat. The BTC ratio of these is then reflected via arbitrage. Do anyone have any other theories?"

  "reddit": "So 2 years ago, after seeing a Netflix documentary about bitcoin, my life has totally changed and I became a crypto addict. I have made so many mistakes, I could have given up so many times, but still, I'm here, more convinced and enthusiastic about crypto than ever. So actually yesterday I started a topic on the Facebook group where most of the people working in the same company as mine are. We are more than 4000 on this group and it's an airline. I didn't expect so many answers of people interested to participate to my course ! And I didn't even finish to write it yet ! I'm not gonna take a random online course already made, I will be much more efficient teaching if I've made it myself. So far I have 50+ people interested. I will make small batches. I told them that I will talk about basics but also some advanced stuff because I can handle it. I want to tell you what I'm going to talk about, but I'd like you to help me if you think I forgot something really Important in the comment. So here are the topics I will approach with my students : -What is bitcoin and crypto in general? I mean I have to start like that, some poeple really have no idea about what it is. -What is the blockchain ? -How is it and will affect our lives? -Facts about bitcoin. Such as it's never been hacked, how many times it crashed and revived, feel free to give me ideas. -How to buy and sell it? This part is easy, but I will set their mind to HODL, not to trade this market ad they will burn their wings and lose. -How to secure it safely ? -Mistakes to avoid as a beginner, like leaving your crypto on an exchange, investing money you actually need to live, avoid scams (heyheyhey) I want them to be wise if their choice. -Useful websites and YouTubers (datadash,Cryptolark) those are my 2 favourites. I unsubscribed from some many after being fed up by their BS. Let me know if you know any I can trust. So I think that this course will take me a couple of hours to discuss, they will ask me questions, for sure other topics will be talked about. I am really excited about it and I feel like it's part of the adoption we need to educated people about crypto and blockchain. So guys, please tell me if I am forgetting very important things to teach to begginers about crypto! I will talk about the mining also when I'll explain what bitcoin is, also the stock to flow, halving... it's gonna be a lot of informations. Thank you for reading."

  "reddit": "Hey everyone, My name is Chris, and I am a community administrator for this token. I thought it would be O.K. to make a post about our coin in this subreddit to help spread the word about this project. This is not a scam, not a schill, or in any way trying to talk about the speculative investment side of token mining/holding. I am strictly presenting this as an opportunity for this community to educate themselves about this token and see if they may want to mine solo or as a part of our mining pool. Essentially, BitcoinSoV was created using 0xBTC's blueprint (PoW using SHA3 algorithm) while also adding a bit of a twist by adding in a 1% burn of every transaction made (deflationary like other coins such as BOMB, Nuke, etc). Our circulating supply is similar to Bitcoin/-0xBTC as we have just under 20,985,000 coins remaining in our total supply (21,000,000 @ launch minus the burns, with only about 1.7 million currently in circulation). Again, I apologize if this is breaking community guidelines. I do not post this here to schill this coin to be sold in any way. This is strictly to inform this community of the opportunity to mine. Etherscan Tracking: Our mining pool link is: Our website: Stats Page: We are also on various forms of social media and we have a telegram community (not listed due to guidelines), which can be found at the following links: Instagram: Twitter: Please take the time to check us out and decide for yourself if you'd like to mine. The information I have provided essentially answers most questions people may have, but if questions still remain users are more then welcome to message me directly or join our telegram to ask another member or admin. Thanks for reading and happy mining!"

If it is like that - again - how can I tell which adress sent what value of LTC to which adress receiving them? When is a transaction irreversible? Right after you sent the LTC or just if it's added to a block?

  "reddit": "Let me preface this by saying I think there are use cases for some altcoins, but not most of them. It seems like a lot of people in this sub want to compare Bitcoin to their coin like Bitcoin is to AOL as their coin is to Google. If you are strictly talking about developing a medium of exchange, then yes that would have benefits, but I want to highlight that people are using Bitcoin today as a store of value. Currencies AS A STORE OF VALUE should not have similar properties to technology products or companies. They should be unchanging and have a strict monetary policy that includes the inability for debasement. This is why cowry shells and gold were once used as media of exchange, but today someone couldn't pay you to take their shells, and gold is at an ATH. The problem with most altcoins is that they are trying to pass the store of value stage and move immediately into the medium of exchange stage. However, 99% of these projects have craeators/CEOs/ and the ability to debate and inflate. If you're confused as to why Bitcoins market dominance keeps growing over your coin, and you really don't understand the monetary policy/distribution of your coin, I would implore you to try to learn more about it. Otherwise it might be a project that isn't worth investing in."

  "reddit": "After a bit of a clear up of my accounts this is what I'm left with. I only invest pocket change so I have small amount of all these, but here they are in descending value of holdings. Bitcoin First bought in 2016. Didn't consider it an investment, just wanted to see how it worked. Link This was a moonshot that paid off. I sold about half as the price pumped recently, but still have enough to make it my 2nd largest hold. Ethereum I stayed away from this for a while as I always thought scaling problems would prevent it from really taking off. Now I trust that those nerds will figure it out, so decided to get some. Got in earlier this year and have seen good gains. Nano This was (I think) my first alt, back when it was RaiBlocks. I bought in around $0.30. Unfortunately i was too greedy and inexperienced to lock in the gains when it rose 10,000% so although I made good margins from this it could have been a lot better. I've lost confidence in the project as I don't think a peer-to-peer currency works without a stable price. I'm holding onto a bit because you never know. BNB I had some of this to cover my Binance fees. As it got close to $10 I got some more. I don't know much about it but I'm glad to have it. XLM I bought this because the team involved were impressive and it seemed like a good project. I sold most of it for BTC early this year which proved to be a lucky move. I'm not hopeful that this will go anywhere. I think it's the only thing I've lost money on apart from a couple of very small moonshot purchases. ENJ I liked the sound of this as it had a solid use case. I sold a lot at various points on it's recent pump. I'm holding onto some on the chance that we hear big news like integration into a popular game or a partnership with a big developer. Moonshots I hold small amounts of SENT, MKR, BAT, QNT, TRTL, VIDT. In most cases I'm hoping they'll land on a major exchange and pump. Then I'll re-assess."

  "reddit": "Why: In an ancient tribe people behave good because they care about the reputation inside their group. And I believe it is a force inside the human being. Only when they trade with other they use money. Reputation is the natural partner of money. And I argue it is missing in Crypto. When cities and empires emerged reputation stopped to work, so laws got invented. Laws are global, and easier to scale than reputation. Today we have the regulators that are trying to find out how to make laws for Cryptocurrency. But now technology should allow us to invent a scalable decentralized reputation. Reputation has been proven to work on sites like Reddit (public reputation giving) or eBay (transaction based reputation). Smart contracts (law with crypto) for sure has its place. But its connection with the real world are still difficult. (Oracles) What: We do not want cooperate reputation - that will extract the money out of us by design. We do not want government reputation - that will lead to power abuse. (exclusion of groups or political views.) The new form of reputation need to be open, decentralized, private, border-less and permission-less. (Thanks Andreas A.) It would also be nice if it can be multi-dimensional: In real live reputation is not only about a number, it is about a certain type of character. And it is about a certain type of abilities. To some people you only want to show part of your reputation (professional, emotional, sexual, moral,..) Ralph Merkel (Famous for Merkel Trees in Bitcoin) made an interesting suggestion for changing a president election. He said, why not let wall street bet what election will result in the highest people satisfaction AFTER the government period. If you translate his idea to eBay. Imagine on eBay your feedback would be a bet on how the seller will satisfy future customers - It could lead to a better feedback. Less emotional. Merkels idea could improve the reputation system. You may think that an anonymous feedback system is just not possible because you could give feedback to your self. I think this can be solved if the value of the feedback is not more than the fee that you pay on a crypto-transaction. If pledged to Bitcoin, people may be happy to pay Bitcoin fees :) You could argue that a reputation can be sold. That is not a problem as long the reputation has more value than the bad you could do with it. Beside that a transfer of a reputation will result in two people having the private key of the reputation. Final Words: This are only ideas. Still, a long way to a white paper, and even longer to an implementation. It is also not something where you can not get rich. Maybe you can get love. But I'm totally convinced that the crypto space need this soo much.Many people here want a working coin without KYC. We want freedom without a thousand of regulations. So we need to find a way to scale the governance of the small tribe to the world. If you have any ideas, critics or know of projects working on it i appreciate your comment."

But this post is not about the price of ICX - tbh it was really flatlined and some used this period of stagnation for accumulating more; some jumped out because of total frustration. However, let's put the price talk aside. More interesting is, what is happening with ICON, ICONLOOP and ICX. What is brewing and what we can expect from this project? -- in my humble opinion, ICON is definitely one of the few altcoin projects which didn't stop pushing everything in the right direction. The opposite was the case, they hired more and more people, have a solid financial base, completed more and more DApps and worked on their connections with the korean government, which is totally important in terms of building out Seoul as a smart city. With \"Broof\"- a certification system on the blockchain - they set another good milestone for that. In the moment ICON is about to get fully decentralized and on the 26th of August we all will witness the Pre-Voting and will be able to stake ICX. ICON will give away 3 Million ICX for all who take part in the Pre-Voting event. Everybody who pre-voted and staked ICX during this period, will get a share of this huge amount of ICX! Investors will be able to vote and stake via the ICONEX wallet, which will be updated in approx. 3 days; exactly when the Pre-Voting period starts. This will be doable in an easy and safe way via a Ledger! Personally, I am happy to see progress here, because I still own some ICX and definitely want to stake. What do you think about the upcoming events of ICON? Have a great day!"

  "reddit": "I want to re-iterate what I was writing in a small syscoin thread, I don't hate SYS and I just wanna use them as a generic example to highlight things that I know are wrong in the startup world. Let's take Syscoin. The team decided to make a decentralized marketplace. Cool? Hell yeah. So they did. They didn't deliver a web version in time though and overshot their timeline but who doesn't right? So we have this decentralized marketplace now and nobody uses it (well almost zero). So in normal startups, you use iterative/agile practices and try to figure out why your users didn't use your MVP and try to make it better so you bring users onboard. IF you have no users, you DO NOT NEED a faster more scalable product. Why? Because you HAVE NO USERS. Seems obvious but even the greatest minds cannot grasp this one. So the Syscoin team without doing any user or community reviews decided that the problem is scalability. So they spend 3-4 years or creating a platform that is indeed state of the art with Z-DAGs and all, super fast, creates tokens does X,Y,Z,Y,W things super fast and it fucking rocks! SO? This is the absolutely worst mistake and it's because of this that all SV startups if they can't find a revenue model and users fast enough pivot. If you spend even a 6 month period on a product that doesn't have users you are a loser and your startup is DONE. This is a very common theme in decentralized world. People make all sorts of projects that can scale to billions of users but even their mother doesn't use them. You know why this happened? Because in Silicon Valley investors that know what they are doing invest in people that know what they are doing. In cryptoworld the general public funded random guys. So fuck scalability and FOCUS on bringing users on your project!"

  "reddit": "We have all been expectantly waiting for alt season. Reminiscing of the days where you could pick a random shitcoin and make 10x overnight. Many naysayers have said those days are over and that that kind of mania wont happen ever again. However, im calling it now. We will have an alt season in the coming month. Bitcoin has now gone through its bear cycle and while some were predicting a 1.5k BTC, smart players were accumulating anywhere under 6k because they had a feeling that BTC had capitulated. I believe alts have capitulated. After Bitcoin’s magnificent rally, which has overshot even the most bullish predictions in such a short time span, the market has become quite stagnant in the past few weeks. It is during this cool-off period that alt season occurs. There have been 3 main observations i have made that lead me to write this post. I have already explained the first. The second goes in parallel after the aforementioned cool off period. That is market dominance. BTC dominance reached a peak of 71% while alts have been grinded to dust in Sat value. The alt market is ripe for profit. In the next weeks we will see a shift in market dominance from Bitcoin to alts. The final observation is the most telling sign. In the past few days there have been several random alt coin pumps of +80%. I see this as little eruptions before big daddy Krakatoa blows. In conclusion, if you expected me to draw some fancy lines on a chart, sorry to disappoint. This analysis is based purely of market sentiment and my previous experience being in the market since 2014. Seeing as we are just beginning the larger Bitcoin 4 year cycle, there aren’t many new investors so this alt season will be short and sweet. Prepare your positions accordingly to make the most profit."

However, blockchain is a decentralized network, where anyone can add information here – similar in the case of Wikipedia. Here the control is shared by multiple independent identities. Distributed Ledger: However, blockchain is also a distributed ledger where data is not stored at a single physical place instead of distributed across various P2P networks. Or we can say that its parts exist in different locations, i.e., not a single server, PC or a device. Transparent and Immutable: Each block in the blockchain is connected to one preceding and one successive block in a tamperproof chain. Once the data is added in the blockchain it becomes permanent, not alterable or removeable. No one has access to remove data from the blockchain, and if a change occurs, a complete history of previous versions remain available. It also prevents duplication or forgery and data theft. So, all these features of blockchain can address the transparency, security, and data issues that our financial, administrative, health, education, and other sectors are facing."

Quick way to get and send info (like email). Amazon was appealing because you could buy books and have them delivered to you. It wasn't for everyone but it was cool enough to start and keep going. So blockchain. For who is this? What's the appeal for humans? It might solve a problem of freedom, but since when people cared that deep about their money? I can already buy a cup of coffee with my phone, I don't need nothing more to that. People don't want complete control, they want to be safe, or \"idiotproof\". If I lose my private keys, my funds are gone forever. If I forgot a pin code to my credit card or forgot a password to my bank account I can just restore it. I think crypto is cool, but there's not even an easy way to buy it!! Let's say I've heard about bitcoin on the tv. You know that I can't buy with the same service in every country. Should I trust binance with my funds and wait till they get hacked? Or should I go to changelly and deal with 7% fees? Why are there fees? Joe doesn't want to convert currencies or read whitepapers, or deal with fees when USD works just fine.

Most of them got into crypto because it seemed like a get-rich-quick scheme. That's a fact, even though crypto is MUCH more than that. I don't know if blockchain is actually the feature, but if it is, we're waiting for something else. We're waiting for another Steve Jobs to realize that it's not convenient to remember a long and random number of symbols as your address, or to wait for your bitcoin transaction to be completed. Blockchain, btc, alts are all awesome, but no awesome enough for it to go mainstream. I want to hear everyone's opinion on promising projects for the joe, not for enthusiasts."

  "reddit": "EDIT: As the people in the comments are saying, I was misinformed. You should still be able to withdraw your funds after the 12th. That said, it is still a good idea to keep your coins off of exchanges and be prepared for taxes, so go ahead and follow the recommendations contained within this post if you feel so inclined. The title says it all. Come September 12th, if you live in the US, you will lose access to your account. Because Binance hasn't released good guidance on how to prepare for this, here is what this means and what you should do about it: 1. If you have crypto sitting on Binance, you need to find a good place to store it that is not on Binance. If it is left on Binance, come September 12th you will no longer be able to access it. You can learn how to store any cryptocurrency on your phone . You can learn how to store ETH and ERC-20 tokens on your computer and how to store bitcoin on your computer . Whatever you choose to do with your crypto, just make sure it isn't on Binance. 2. If you have traded crypto in 2019, you will need to export all the data on these trades in the form of a csv or to a crypto tax service such as . This will ensure that you are prepared to pay taxes on the trades you made on Binance. If you do those two things you will have nothing to worry about when you are no longer able to access in a few weeks. If you only one or none of these things, you just might have a problem on your hands at some point down the road. Lastly, if this news feels overwhelming to you, we have been helping our consulting clients prepare for this transition, and we would be glad to help you too! You can learn more about our consulting services by following the link below or by sending an email to . I hope you found this post helpful, and I hope you are prepared to be kicked off of Binance if you live in the US. Leave a comment if you have any questions!"

Obviously, I'm not naive enough to believe that there are no political agendas involved in spreading this narrative. Nor am I ignorant enough to overlook what the real causes of global warming is. However, I'm not sure whether the environmental impact due to Bitcoin mining is significant enough (or has the potential to be significant enough in the future) to at least take this claim somewhat seriously. In this regard, I've been searching for videos of Andreas Antonopoulos addressing this question. I found one, but his answer was unsatisfactorily short.

  "reddit": "SEED Group, a member of The Private Office of Sheikh Saeed bin Ahmed Al Maktoum in The UAE signs a strategic business and technology partnership with two of the world’s leading blockchain organisations, Blocko Inc. and the Aergo Foundation, to help government and other large organisations to further innovate, embrace and deploy high-scale and highly-secure blockchain solutions to accelerate the regions digital transformation for its citizens and businesses. • Deployment of Aergo, a world-leading pioneering blockchain platform, across MENA • Blocko’s enterprise blockchain design, implementation and knowledge/skills transfer • Advanced energy efficiency, quantum-resistant, and secure digital asset capabilities https://i.redd.it/5hz6ljvaqle31.png Dubai, United Arab Emirates – August 5, 2019 – SEED Group today announced that it has entered into a strategic partnership with the AERGO Foundation and Blocko Inc., a leading enterprise blockchain platform provider to provide local government and large companies with secure, scalable and high-performance solutions built around blockchain. UAE Vision 2021 directly aims to achieve social and economic development across the region and requires a shift to a diversified and knowledge-based economy. The agreement aims to address the most demanding and complex problems for organizations that aim to become part of this advanced digital ecosystem centered in Dubai but extending beyond the Middle East. Following five years of successful large scale industrial in-production deployments with some of the largest companies in the world and with over 25million active user in firms such as Samsung and Hyundai, the AERGO Foundation and its strategic partner Blocko are bringing their technology platform, IT integration and execution know-how to Dubai. The prime objective is to help make the digitization programs of UAE Vision 2021 and Saudi Vision 2030 a reality. Many blockchain technologies today are either still in the proof-of-concept phase, are too complex to use, or do not have the capabilities to provide the performance and scale needed to secure millions of devices and users. An architecture is needed that can support multi-level business ecosystems and all-digital supply chains. AERGO, perhaps the world’s leading open-source hybrid blockchain platform, aims to address these needs by working with SEED Group. “As the UAE and Middle East region start to build more advanced blockchain solutions for government services and our digital economies, we constantly get asked to identify innovative companies that can operate at the highest levels of security and scale. We are thrilled to be partnering with both the AERGO Foundation and Blocko. They have proven they can deliver and will now help the region to make its digital promise a reality for its citizens and businesses” said Hisham Al Gurg, CEO of SEED Group. Won-Beom Kim, CEO and founder of Blocko that is backed by Samsung Ventures, said “it is both an honour and huge responsibility to be trusted and empowered through our partnership with SEED to take initiatives such as Smart Dubai and the Dubai Future Foundation to the next level of realization. Our advanced blockchain RD team are ready for the challenge and we will immediately deploy a specialist team in Dubai to make this happen. Furthermore and through our academic research partners, some of the most advanced identity solutions, blockchain consensus algorithms, and energy-efficient cryptography will be made available to organizations that need to move beyond proof of concept experimentation to large scale highly secure deployments”. “Proven technologies, developer-friendly capabilities, an open architecture – and a willingness to provide knowledge transfer by working with local partners – are core principles of the AERGO Foundation. As blockchain usage grows, solutions will be required to address very complex needs such as quantum-resistant and low energy blockchains. Securing digital assets, citizen identities and billions of IoT devices with distributed ledger technologies will also be needed. AERGO Foundation and its partners will bring these bleeding-edge innovations to The UAE via our exciting collaboration with the SEED Group” said Phil Zamani, CEO and founder of AERGO. The partnership is about impact with organisations ready to embrace blockchain. About Blocko Inc. Blocko helps governments and large enterprises to design, deploy and manage high performance and security solutions and services built around an advanced hybrid blockchain platform. Recognized as one of the world’s most experienced companies in this space, having already helped many organizations to deploy production systems on blockchain, it develops and supports Aergo, an enterprise-ready blockchain operating platform that leverages and extends both public and private blockchains via best-of-breed cloud computing. Aergo’s flexible and familiar architecture allows organizations to build and deploy practical decentralized applications and enterprise-IT solutions on an industry-leading high-performance hybrid blockchain architecture that can be deployed on a full-stack (and low-cost) serverless computing platform. About SEED Group Over the past 16 years, SEED Group has formed strategic alliances with leading global companies representing diverse regions and industries. These companies have propelled their business interests and goals in the Middle East and North Africa region through the support and strong base of regional connections of the SEED Group. The Group’s goal is to create mutually beneficial partnerships with multinational organizations and to accelerate their sustainable market entry and presence within the MENA region. SEED Group has been a key point in the success of all its partners in the region helping them reach their target customers and accelerate their businesses.

  "reddit": "https://i.redd.it/0jnmefjjbme31.jpg The cryptocurrency market is littered with what most people call “dead coins”. These are cryptocurrencies that exist with almost no market value mostly as a result of insignificant network effect. Several reasons could lead to a cryptocurrency becoming a “dead coin”, even though in the actual sense it is difficult to establish that a coin is completely dead. Some of these reasons include the disappearance of a project team, inability to follow through on promises, bad management, conflict within a project’s community and outright scam. In the past decade that cryptocurrencies have existed, many coins have fallen into this category. Let’s take a look at the top 5 cryptocurrencies with a lot of promise that never made it. 5. SpaceBIT The goal of SpaceBIT, at least what was communicated to the public, was to create a blockchain product that will launch several nano-satellites into space providing a globally accessible blockchain. This idea was made known to the public in 2014, and news about it was still all over the blockchain industry into 2015 and the community waited with palpable enthusiasm. Everyone looked forward to the project until the propagators went silent. Reports indicate that the SpaceBIT team diverted into another project, BlockVerify. This took their attention off SpaceBIT and it became an abandoned project till date. 4. GEMS Gems, which later became “GetGems” tried to build a decentralized social app that will reward users for viewing advertisements within the app. At the time, the project team described it as the eventual disruptor of social media as we knew it. Unfortunately for Gems, a failed crowdsale exercise in 2014 discouraged the team and community over the planned execution. Only $111,000 was raised during the crowdsale, in an ecosystem that similar projects were raising millions of dollars. The team continued with the development of the project still, but adoption level is nothing to write home about. 3. DOGECOIN Also created in 2014 in what looked like an unserious ambition, DOGE became a cryptocurrency that was used by its community for charitable causes. A popular case was when it was used to raise funds to sponsor the Jamaican bobsled team to the winter Olympics. This act boosted publicity for the coin and it grew. Unfortunately, the Dogecoin exchange crashed, and the founder, Alex Green vanished with all the funds. That was it for DOGE which still exists today, but in a crashed mode with almost nothing to show for its past performance. 2. PAYCOIN Paycoin fell really hard in 2015 after its founder Josh Garza fled the US while being investigated for fraudulent activities surrounding the project. The journey of Paycoin started in 2014 with a beautifully crafted whitepaper that attracted a sizeable community. With GAW miners, who were in partnership with Garza at the time, failing to follow through with its promises, things began to go south for the project. GAW finally shut down in 2015, leading to investigation by the authorities, which led to the fleeing of Garza as mentioned above. The community that Garza left behind have tried to revive the project, all to no avail. 1. DAO Ethereum’s DAO breach of 2016 remains the biggest fail so far in the cryptocurrency industry. The promise of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) was too good that its tokens were bought in droves during a crowdsale. The over $168 million achievement in the DAO crowdsale was a record-breaking event. In June 2016, an attacker took advantage of a vulnerability in the DAO system and stole $50 million. This was the beginning of the end for DAO, as traders dumped the token. Ultimately, this was what led to the eventual fork of Ethereum to create the new Ethereum platform with the Ether tokens, alongside the existing Ethereum Classic platform with token ETC. Conclusion Coin fails are common in the crypto world and a lot of investors are still suffering from the losses sustained from failed projects. However, things are beginning to change in the industry, with the project determined to revive the so-called dead coins, bringing liquidity back to their owners. The aim of CoinJanitor is to identify “dead” coins with large communities that are unable to trade their purchased tokens, helping users who have put money into the market, get money out. CoinJanitor restores the dead coins value through JAN coins, which can be traded on several exchanges. This is an interesting arrangement that will certainly draw the attention of a lot of investors in the cryptocurrency market."

  "reddit": "tl;dr - July was a down month, but still up +74% in 2019. Bitcoin wins the month, overall Litecoin holds the smallest of leads, all cryptos in positive territory for the year except Stellar and XRP. The Experiment: Instead of hypothetically tracking cryptos,. I then repeated the experiment on the 1st of January 2019. Think of it as a lazy man's Index Fund (no weighting or rebalancing), less technical, more fun (for me at least), and hopefully still a proxy for the market as a whole - or at the very least an interesting snapshot of the 2019 crypto space. Trying to keep it simple and accessible for beginners and those looking to get into crypto but maybe not quite ready to jump in yet. The Rules: Buy $100 of each the Top 10 cryptocurrencies on January 1st, 2019. Run the experiment two years. Hold only. No selling. No trading. Report monthly. Compare loosely to the . Month Seven - Up 74% https://i.redd.it/q1zu3e4m3ne31.png July hit the 2019 Top Ten portfolio hard, with a nearly -40% drop since the end of June. All cryptos are in the red except Bitcoin and Tether. June showed sideways movement, but July decisively breaks the five month win streak (or more preciously, a four-month-win-plus-one-month-sideways streak). That said, the 2019 Top Ten portfolio is still up +74% on the year. Ranking https://i.redd.it/dsoc7m9u3ne31.png Lots of movement this month. All of the Top Ten cryptos moved except Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. Of note, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash which switched places with each other again, Stellar reclaimed its spot in the Top Ten, and EOS dropped two spots to #8. Tron is now alone as the only Top Ten dropout and has been replaced by Binance Coin. July Winners \\- Bitcoin, easily. All others (except Tether) were down double digits, with most falling over -20%. July Losers \\- Tron, easily, losing nearly 1/3rd of its value, down -32% in July. EOS had a rough month too, dropping -26% and two places in the rankings. For those keeping score, here is tally of which coins have the most monthly wins and loses during the first seven months of this experiment: Bitcoin distinguished itself from the pack this month by achieving its second monthly victory of the year. Bitcoin SV still has the most monthly loses: three out of the first seven months. https://i.redd.it/mbqz58n04ne31.png Overall update – Litecoin holds the smallest of leads, all cryptos in positive territory except Stellar and Ripple Similar to last month, although Bitcoin makes the headlines, it's actually Litecoin that continues to perform best, up +214% on the year. My initial $100 investment in Litecoin is now worth $321. But for the second month in a row, Bitcoin made up a ton of ground, finishing July just a few percentage points behind Litecoin. Stellar is at the bottom, down -28% so far in 2019, followed by Ripple, down -10%. Total Market Cap for the entire cryptocurrency sector: https://i.redd.it/y6pm81g64ne31.png For the first time since February, the total crypto market cap decreased, losing about $13B in July. Still, the overall market cap remains over $300B, an increase of +143% since the beginning of 2019. Bitcoin dominance: https://i.redd.it/79c40ey84ne31.png Bitcoin dominance leaped again in July, and now is close to 68%. This sets another record for Bitcoin dominance so far in the 2019 and. Overall return on investment from January 1st, 2019: https://i.redd.it/aizrumub4ne31.png In July I saw my overall return shrink by about $400, quite a hit. If I cashed out today, my $1,000 initial investment would return $1,744, a +74% gain. Not at all bad compared to the stock market: the return I would have received from investing that same $1000 on January 1st, 2019 in the the SP 500 is about +17%, same as last month (see below). Implications/Observations: Although the overall market ended down on the month, it's still up 143% on the year. What's noteworthy this month is the absolute chasm that's opened between the performance of the market overall and the Top Ten cryptos that I started with at the beginning of 2019. My Top Ten group? Up 74%. That's only half the return of the overall market. Remember, in May, the gains from the Top Ten and the entire market were both exactly the same amount: +114%. This month, not even close. For two straight months, focusing only on the Top Ten has been a losing strategy. This is reminiscent of last year as . I'm also tracking the SP 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point with other popular investments options. The SP 500 was flat in July, still up +17% since the beginning of 2019. Solid gains, but of course nothing like what we've seen in crypto so far this year. The initial $1k investment I put into crypto would have yielded +$170 had it been redirected to the SP compared to the $744 I'm currently up with the 2019 Top Ten Cryptos. https://i.redd.it/dalip23i4ne31.png Conclusion: July was an obvious down month for crypto. I've been a bit delayed on the update this month so as I'm putting this together, crypto's been on a bit of an upward run, with Bitcoin looking like it's about to test $12k. The monthly nature of these updates prevents me from getting caught up in the daily fluctuations of the crypto market and allows a bit of perspective. Taking a step back, it looks, at this point at least, like July was a bit of a speedbump, but by no means signals a crypto bear market - the overall trend of the first half of 2019 is unmistakably positive. If you're just finding this experiment now, here's the backstory: On the 1st of January, 2018, I bought $100 each of the Top Ten cryptos at the time for a total investment of $1000 to see how they would perform over the year. I tracked the experiment and reported each month. The result? After last year's experiment ended, I decided to do two things: 1. Extend the Top Ten 2018 Crypto project one more year. The experiment is now in its 19th month. You can check out the latest update . 2. What you're reading now is the 7th report of a parallel project: this year I repeated the experiment, purchasing another $1000 ($100 each) of the new Top Ten cryptos as of January 1st, 2019. Thanks for reading and the support for the experiment. I hope you’ve found it helpful. I continue to be committed to seeing this process through and reporting along the way. Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports."

  "reddit": "Please bear with me as I'm trying to understand how the utility of CryptoCurrency works, when it comes to creating a platform where that CryptoCurrency is used, I get lost along the steps of how it works, let's break it down: So company X creates (Coin) to be utilized on PlatformX to trade Software for example. An ICO is launched, the company issue 10 Million Coin for $10M Dollars, Crypto investors buy them, they're delivered to their wallets, and traded on an exchange. The Coin utility is intended for buying and selling Software on PlatformX. This is where I get lost, the company has taken the $10M Dollars and used the funds for platform development. What is now backing the Coins that are supposed to be consumed by the platform? If Emily is a user of the platform, and wants to buy software priced at 10 Coins. And John owns 10 Coins (through ICO), in his Crypto wallet connected to the exchange, is Emily then purchasing the Coins from John directly? and they get delivered to her through the exchange and he gets paid by her money? therefore the supply of coins for the platform is coming from the exchange? Or is Emily buying 10 Coins from the platform owner company directly, from an issued amount exceeding the initial 10 Million Coins issued at ICO? Also, I understand that the Coin price is driven by supply and demand on the exchange, but how is the value of the Coin on the exchange tied to the platform growth (or company prosperity) so it would rise or drop in value? Thank you and sorry if I'm being annoying with my noob questions."

For example: If a coin promises to be a means of transaction, but is very impractical to use and has no functional alternatives (on first or second layer) for the foreseeable future, that coin should be labeled a shitcoin regardless of how many people have expressed interest in owning it and whatever it’s current market cap. Conversely, any coin that presently does deliver on its central promise should not be labeled a shitcoin, whatever it’s market cap. Any other method of deciding “shitcoin” from not shitcoin is susceptible to various biases and misconception - confirmation bias (or, very slow confirmation bias), bandwagon fallacy, anchor bias, etc. Correct me where I’m wrong...?"

  "reddit": "Sorry if this is a repost or in the wrong place or whatever. I am interested in trading cryptocurrencies on my few months off work coming up. I know a guy who I used to work with, and I watched him do trades by the hour on a program like binance. I personally watched hime make up to $400 a day so I know it's possible. I've never known how to do it but Ive been looking into it lately. I saw that guy cryptojack makes a tutorial over 5 weeks called bitcoin blueprint. I can not find any reviews on the program and anything supporting it seems to be from his facebook page so I can't trust it. There are some places saying bitcoin blueprint is a scam but then they reference an app that automatically trades for you unlike the tutorial I am wondering about. Can anybody shed some light on this or at least point me in the write diection to find an answer before I pay for this tutorial?"

  "reddit": "How would Dai fare if there was a global recession? I suspect ETH to go down and bitcoin to steadily rise. So, wouldn't that mean Dai would be worth more than a dollar since it uses Etherum as a value instrument or would something occur that would force Dai to stay a dollar. At which makes Dai worthless in sense of the market? Basically, would they raise the liquidation fee rate to an extreme amount or just collapse? For example, you deposited 1 ETH and generated 90 dai where you bought Bitcoin with it. ETH collapses down to trading $120 and you buyback the 1 ETH you bought with Dai later on by selling back the bitcoin. Doesn't that mean you gained $65 minus the liquidation fee since you keep that ETH? But if that isn't the case, is there even a point in getting Dai and just buying Bitcoin outright? Basically, is this a way to figuratively short ETH? Because in the end 1 for 1 US dollar is of little importance to me."

  "reddit": "ok, so firstly, all of the papers I found through Google search and Google scholar. Google scholar doesn't actually have every research paper so you need to use both together to find them all. They were all found by using phrases like \"predict bitcoin\" or \"predict stock market\" or \"predict forex\" and terms related to those. Next, I only tested papers written in the past 8 years or so, I think anything older is just going to be heavily Alpha-mined so we can probably just ignore those ones altogether. Then, Anything where it's slightly ambiguous with methodology, I tried every possible permutation to try and capture what the authors may have meant. For example, one paper adds engineered features to the price then says \"then we ran the data through our model\" - it's not clear if it means the original data or the engineered data, so I tried both ways. This happens more than you'd think! THEN, Anything that didn't work, I tried my own ideas with the data they were using or substituted one of their models with others that I knew of. Now before we go any further, I should caveat that I was a profitable trader at multiple Tier-1 US banks so I can say with confidence that I made a decent attempt of building whatever the author was trying to get at. Oh, and one more thing. All of this work took about 7 months in total. Right, let's jump in. So with the papers, I found as many as I could, then I read through them and put them in categories and then tested each category at a time because a lot of papers were kinda saying the same things. Here are the categories: News Text Mining. \\- This is where they'd use NLP on headlines or the body of news as a signal. Social data - Twitter Sentiment/Google Search/Seeking Alpha. Again, some were NLP, for google trends they just used the data. Technical Analysis Machine Learning together. Most of these would take the price, add TA features, then feed into a ML model. Other machine learning (as in, not using TA). Just using the price and some other engineered features. Analyst Recommendations. Literally just taking the recommendations from banks/brokers and using that as the signal. Fundamental data. So ratios from the income statement/balance sheet, Results: Literally every single paper was either p-hacked, overfit, or a subsample of favourable data was selected (I guess ultimately they're all the same thing but still) OR a few may have had a smidge of Alpha but as soon as you add transaction costs it all disappears. Every author that's been publicly challenged about the results of their paper says it's stopped working due to \"Alpha decay\" because they made their methodology public. The easiest way to test whether it was truly Alpha decay or just overfitting by the authors is just to reproduce the paper then go further back in time instead of further forwards. For the papers that I could reproduce, all of them failed regardless of whether you go back or forwards. :) Now, results from the two most popular categories were: \\Social data.\\A lot of research papers were extensions of or based off of a paper by Johan Bollen called \"Twitter mood predicts the stock market\". It literally has 3,955 citations and is complete and utter horse shit; the paper is p-hacking to the extreme. Not only could I not reproduce the results, but given the number of sentiment indicators he uses I regularly found correlations between sentiment and my data based on how I engineered it. None of these correlations held over longer time periods. Every paper that's a derivative of this one or cites it has the same issues. \\Technical analysis machine learning.\\Every paper would do something along the lines of.. take past price data for some asset (stocks, forex), then add technical analysis indicators as \"features\". Then either they'd run through a feature-selector that figures out the best features then put the best ones into a model OR they'd dump this data straight into the model and afterwards select the subset of instruments that it \"worked\" on. None of these would hold if you k-fold test them or test on different subsets of data outside of the ones used in the paper. The results are always based off of selecting favourable subsets of data. The most frustrating paper: I have true hate for the authors of this paper: \"A deep learning framework for financial time series using stacked autoencoders and long-short term memory\". Probably the most complex AND vague in terms of methodology and after weeks trying to reproduce their results (and failing) I figured out that they were leaking future data into their training set (this also happens more than you'd think). The two positive take-aways that I did find from all of this research are: 1. Almost every instrument is mean-reverting on short timelines and trending on longer timelines. This has held true across most of the data that I tested. Putting this information into a strategy would be rather easy and straightforward (although you have no guarantee that it'll continue to work in future). 2. When we were in the depths of the great recession, almost every signal was bearish (seeking alpha contributors, news, google trends). If this holds in the next recession, just using this data alone would give you a strategy that vastly outperforms the index across long time periods. Hopefully if anyone is getting into this space this will save you an absolute tonne of time and effort. So in conclusion, if you're building trading strategies, simple is good :) Also one other thing I'd like to add, even the Godfather of value investing, the late Benjamin Graham (Warren Buffet's mentor) used to test his strategies (even though he'd be trading manually) so literally every investor needs to backtest regardless of if you're day-trading or long-term investing or building trading algorithms.

  "reddit": "Let's first start from fundamental analysis which is not much important in other financial markets like Forex and Stocks, many well known and famous and successful traders/investors reveal in there books why fundamental analysis is not important. But in Crypto Market fundamental analysis is an important thing to consider before actually investing in any project. It is a newly established Market and Fundamental things like updates, new features affect prices. Before choosing a crypto project for investment, it is important to see the fundamentals behind the project. So, you can determine the future potential of the project. privacy coins are in discussion nowadays. I wrote about some of the best privacy coins in the past like conceal and Beam (but I'm not a professional writer: lol). And now it's time to look at fastly developing Privacy focused coin Ryocurrency. Technically if you look at its daily chart it is trading on a major and key support level and fundamentals are strong behind the project and there are a lot of new features and updates on the way. Its is a reflection of what Project devs have already done and what is happing now and what is going to happen in the future. What devs have already done in the past? The first thing that comes into my mind is it's HAHS ALOGIRTHM, which is completely unique and build from scratch and it supports both AMD and Nvidia GPU's. Even low memory and cheap cards. (I don't want to go into mining stuff but this is just a fact to talk about). Second It's wallets which are the most secure wallets in the crypto space, and they introduce the first wallet ever with solo mining feature (Check out this to know more about Atom wallet features), Another good development is for increasing the privacy level for its users. They increased the Ringsize from 13 to 25 and added bulletproof to ensure the anonymity of users. This was the past. Let's talk about the features and updates that are on the way and might affect prices in the bullish direction (I also call this fundamental's behind the project). There is no doubt that project devs have such great development skills. Their upcoming update ECC that will increase wallet startup operations up to 2x to 5x according to Ryo leading dev . After that Atomic swaps are on the way that will enable Ryo users to exchange their coins against BTC directly from their wallets, without involving any third party. This is the easiest, secure and cheap way of exchanging coins. Mobile wallets will be available by the end of 2019 for android and as well as for IOS. There are a lot of other features and updates that you can read by yourself from its . If someone is looking for a crypto project to invest in. I think Ryocurrecny would be a great choice, as I told you the fundamentals are strong behind the project and devs are delivering. Project current market cap is $400k+ but as we know things happen quickly in the crypto space and BTC is an example of it. Adoption doesn't happen overnight it is step by step process after looking and doing research on this project, I feel Ryo adoption will be huge and it's kind of project with moonshot potential. The best time to invest in a project when it in the early stages and showing up something different and unique from the development end."

  "reddit": "To me this is huge threat to all cryptocurrency trading. If a government takes control over Tether they could wipe out all trader profits with the push of a button. So a trader thinks they are smart by keeping their profits in stable coins. When Bitcoin goes down 25% in one day, the trader thinks: ha I am not affected. But what he does not know is that one day, his entire profit might get frozen and he has traded all that time for absolutely nothing. While if the Bitcoin price goes down even 90% at least you still have all those Bitcoins if you keep them in your own wallet. Even if you keep your Tether in your own wallet. The way Tether is set up as OMNI token it can be frozen BY tether. Which means it can be frozen by anybody that takes control of tether. This is the big risk of centralised systems build on top of Bitcoin. You think they are safe because they are build on top of Bitcoin but it really depends on how they are structured. Other stablecoins might be setup in a way where they cannot be controlled by the initial issuer. And finally the only real stable coin is DAI which is being kept stable by math rather then trust. So as a trader you could have the biggest stories about Bitcoin and how Bitcoin is government by the laws of mathematics and not human trust. If then you are still parking your trading profit in to Tether on a daily basis. (which the market shows most traders do as Tether sometimes does 4 times it entire market cap in volume in one day. Which means every trader on average would make 4 crypto to tether and back trades per day) Well then you not living by the same rules you are preaching. Mark my words. One day Tether will burn so many traders who preach the decentralised gospel but don't live by it themselves."

  "reddit": "Source: ELI5 Elastos: Elastos is an operating system, a decentralised internet and a Virtual Machine (VM) tool all wrapped up into one. It has its own operating system to run on devices without one (e.g. IoT devices), it aims to improve security by using the blockchain as an internet protocol rather than TCP/IP and it allows DApps to run across any operating system - including phones - using what is essentially a VM (called Elastos Runtime). It works to improve security by assigning everything running on Elastos (including devices, digital assets, servers, DApps) their own ID or 'Universal Unique Identifier'. This is checked on startup by the Elastos blockchain and only following validation is an internet connection established. This aids prevent DDoS attacks. Furthermore as all DApps run on Runtime they do not touch the device, Elastos OS or any other DApp - they essentially operate in a vacuum. There are other projects which aim to do some parts of Elastos but there are none (to my knowledge) that are trying to combine it all as Elastos is attempting to do. What is it? Let’s break down the whitepaper bit by bit, beginning with the introduction and vision: Elastos aims to create a new kind of Internet, powered by blockchain technology: This is similar to many of the claims made about Ethereum and others. Elastos wants to make digital assets scarce, identifiable and tradable. Property rights pave the way for wealth creation, and Elastos intends to build a new World Wide Web that respects those rights: Whilst there are other projects sharing this goal, I’m not sure any of the other platforms have made this as high a priority as Elastos have, given this in the opening paragraph of the whitepaper. The goal is to create an Internet that allows users to access articles, movies and games directly, without going through a media player or another platform intermediary: Again, there are other projects aiming to let people do this but it is more DApps aiming to do this, not platforms. It is interesting that they aim to bypass other media players entirely here. Elastos will be a platform for decentralized applications (Dapps) that runs on a peer-to-peer network with no centralized control: Nothing particularly new here. People can access these Dapps via their mobile phones, without changing their operating system: This is interesting and the first part of the project which really stands out. One of the main issues with a lot of DApps is the inability to run them on mobile phones at present. Elastos wants to create a new World Wide Web that is safer and smarter, and that can one day be known as the Internet of Wealth: Continuing the confused marketing theme, burying the vision (actually located at the end of the whitepaper) is an odd move and it is unclear what a smarter WWW might actually resemble."

  "reddit": "Of course there are obvious and simple examples of exit scams. I am asking about the less obvious cases. Consider the two examples over the course of one or two years: Developers are active, but the community is dwindling, and the price has dropped to almost nothing. Developers are inactive, but the community is strong, and the price has maintained a steady value. In the first example, die-hard fans say their project is a sleeping giant. In the second example, the price is propped up by community interest and not many people question it. In both cases people inevitably say the project is dead. What makes these projects dead or alive? It seems to depend heavily on who you ask. There are many subtle points to consider. Developers may be active, but they may be contributing insignificantly, or taking the project in a direction that is very different from the original plan. Developers may be relatively inactive, but the working product is sound, and occasional small updates keep the product relevant. There are countless other factors that can make the definiton of a dead project somewhat loose. Out of sheer curiosity I would like to know how you personally define it, so I can get a sense of what the community believes."

As much as I believe in the decentralization, I don't believe in current retail investors. Big tech support seems like a valid proof that the project is worthy. 2. Good tokenomics. If you can't see the token model working it most probably won't, and if it's not working - the utility is questionable. And that always bad in the long run. 3. Fanbase, aka fanatically supportive community. Community support can't be underestimated. 4. Incentives for long term hold: staking can be a good one. I have been longing LTO, NOIA and LINK (till recently) based on this approach and it seems quite good. What attributes can you suggest?"

  "reddit": "The latest trend I see from some crypto people (especially the ones who have a vested interest in BTC failing) is to attack BTC's store of value. Justin Sun, tweeted recently that if Bitcoin was a store of value it wouldn't have wild price swings. My first reaction to this is, I thought Justin was a lot smarter than this... My overall reaction is...what about all the other things we use in our daily lives. There is this ignorant notion that somehow a dollar is, and has always been a dollar. This couldn't be further from the truth. Because of inflation, capitalism, and other factors, a dollar in 1999 does not hold the same value as a dollar now. A dollar in 1999 could have bought you one gallon of gasoline depending on where you bought it from. Today that same dollar will buy 0.2-0.4 gallons of gasoline. In 1984 one dollar bought you 20 white castle burgers! Yet, because people SEE a dollar they think it has the same value. Other things we use daily that fluctuate in price Health insurance gold milk bacon avocados chips all parts of the chicken beef lumber real estate even water In fact my last water bill was 300% higher this past month than the previous month. No explanation was given. Every time these things fluctuate in value, your fiat fluctuates in value. If you actually tracked the value of the dollar since its creation, its chart would look like a nose dive. Yet, currently there are about 9 trillion dollars in bank accounts, and other types of accounts in the US alone (with only about 30 billion in FDIC insurance...let that sink in) The biggest stores of value in the US are stocks. Which fluctuate in value every day. Bitcoin has \"wild price swings\" you say? Dish network stock has lost 60% of its value in the last 5 years. In that same time frame Bitcoin is up 2500% to 4000% Tell me which one you would have rather held over the last 5 years? \"But gold...gold is where you should put your money...\" If you bought gold in 2014 you're up 25% right now. Wonderful. But if you bought gold in 2012 you're actually down 20% right now. But yet somehow gold, with an unknown amount of supply, and an unknown amount of demand, is the ultimate store of value. Oh by the way if you hadn't noticed, the price HAS fluctuated...alot. But I've never heard anyone say you shouldn't invest in gold because the price fluctuates too much. The most important point is...Bacon is too damn expensive and I no longer eat it! Seriously though,,,Bitcoin beats everything...literally...as a store of value in terms of what's available. It doesn't mean it will always be that way. But if you're comparing BTC to dollars...there really is no comparison."

  "reddit": "Some observations about how there isn't going to be another huge bull run like the one seen in 2017-2018. I know so many people irl who heard of cryptos during the 2017-2018 boom, and then lost tons of money. One lost even in bitconnect. I think the 2017-18 boom was driven by basically clueless first time buyers, who didn't understand anything, but kept buying coins till they were going up. I have heard of con-men who wrote in their newsletters that cryptos were going to give 10x returns \\at minimum\\. They were promising 100x returns for many. Lot of gullible buyers bought coins, which at first drove up the prices. That was the origin and reason of the 2017-2018 bull run. When the prices fell, which they had to because of unrealistic expectations of profits, the same buyers took loss. Almost none of them are going to buy cryptos again. Not just that, they are going to tell 10 other people their experiences, and the rest aren't also going to buy cryptos with unreal expectations. The silver lining, is that the pre-2017 population, which we'd call more tech savvy, will continue to remain in this space. More will continue to come in too with time, but the rate at which people enter crypto space is much less than what can make drastic price rise."

  "reddit": "I recently posted a competitive analysis on /r/EthTrader on ETH vs BTC as crypto-money, that I thought was comprehensive enough to share in /r/CryptoCurrency. I think ETH just doesn't have enough of an advantage over BTC as a form of money to overcome BTC's first mover advantage and displace it in the marketplace yet. Let's do a competitive analysis on use as money: Advantages: Utility in DeFi applications - including lending, staking, borrowing, trading, shorting/longing, etc Faster confirmations Flexible block size limit - can adjust to surges in demand with miners voting to raise the gas limit Interoperable with token economy which is the dominant one in cryptocurrency Far more promising scaling roadmap, both on the base layer and on the application layer, thanks to versatility offered by Turing-Completeness, like being able to do Plasma challenge games and use zk-\\[NT\\]ARKs More promising future privacy, in being able to utilize technologies like ring signatures and zk-\\[NT\\]ARKs More promising future environmental foot print More promising future supply-demand dynamics, with demand for mining equipment being converted to demand for ETH in switch to Proof of Stake More promising long-term security subsidy, with BTC's security subsidy going to zero and ETH's continuing in perpetuity More promising future use-cases with Turing-Complete-ness giving it far more potential capabilities Disadvantages: Less liquidity as BTC has more liquidity on centralized exchanges, and centralized exchanges have far more volume than the decentralized ones where ETH is dominant (though DEXes will improve much faster than CEXes, and see their market share grow with substantial volume - so ETH's primacy in DEXes is very good for its prospects of becoming the dominant crypto-money) Fewer advocates on social media promoting it as a decentralized money - a result of not being the first mover with the largest market cap and most investors Less credibility as an immutable and uncensorable currency/blockchain - 1. with comments from key players like Vlad Zamfir arguing for social intervention to interfere with autonomous operation and 2. with the DAO hard fork early in Ethereum's history. In reality, ETH has a very good chance of developing into a highly immutable/censorship-resistant/autonomous blockchain due to the principles held by important players, including its most influential, Vitalik Buterin, and its design choices, but its credibility is still slightly less than BTC's in this regard. A less-recognized brand - BTC has the 'Bitcoin' brand, which is the flag bearer for cryptocurrency Less privacy right now - Ethereum has practically no privacy right now, and much less than BTC. BTC was launched using a UTXO model, and currently all major wallets manage addresses for the user to avoid address re-use. All of ETH's wallets have been designed around the account-model, which would be like BTC's wallets all reusing addresses by default. While BTC still has very poor privacy, even this modest amount of privacy makes it much more appealing to use for many people in many applications than ETH. More risky scaling roadmap, with ambitious changes that could have flaws that lead to chaotic hard-fork fixes and major roll-backs The market is less aware of its advantages than its diadvantages, because its advantages involve emerging cryptocurrency technology that most of the market doesn't understand. Also, some of the disadvantages are in areas that are critical to using ETH as money, like privacy, where ETH's lack of functionality depresses its use in all other monetary applications, including basic peer-to-peer value transfers, retail usage, DeFi transactions and token trades. ETH is getting better, with much more potential for improvement than BTC, but some of the features it needs, like scalability and privacy, and their implementation across Ethereum wallets, are very hard problems that will take a lot of time to solve."

  "reddit": "The fact is that pretty much every single altcoin is trying to solve for a problem that doesn't exist yet. Faster transactions? Pretty sure nobody has a problem with visa in that regard. Low fees? Who cares about low fees if your coin has to instantly be transferred back into fiat at a 20% tax rate because no cryptocurrency is stable at all and wont be in the near future? \"But wait! - Blockchain will save all of our personal data!\" - Wut? The question you should ask yourself before plopping 100's to 1000's of dollars into any coin is - how many fully validating nodes are contributing to the network stability, and do you see that number increasing or decreasing based on the coin's monetary policy? Unfortunately, this plays out as a chicken or egg scenario, since the mere fact that a low node count means the monetary policy could likely change at any time, unbeknownst to the holder. And what chance does the node count have to grow if potential node runners don't have expectations of a good store of value? Bitcoin is the end-all-be-all because it solves for the problem that currently exists today - which a system with an unchangeable monetary policy, with massive decentralization due to it's small block size, with the security of 80 million terahashes behind it. People need to wake up to the fact that this is why Bitcoin is popular. Not because it has instant, low fee transactions. Therefore this market is highly irrational right now, and we are going to see a massive shift away from all altcoins to Bitcoin in the near future."

  "reddit": "Google has made some serious advances when it comes to reCaptchas, and they’re extremely impressive. Unless you value your privacy… https://i.redd.it/ja5j5i1mozd31.png Check here if you are not a robot. If you are not a robot, can you read this nonsensical string of letters and numbers that looks like it’s been wrung out like a wet towel? Can you choose the picture of a car out of these nine street scenes? Over the years, Google has come up with a number of ways to verify that internet users, especially when signing into accounts, are not, in fact, bots. The most up-to-date system, reCaptcha v3, stands to big up web security, but comes with some serious privacy compromises. The new reCaptcha is invisible to the user. No more clicking through pictures of street signs and dogs. According to Cy Khormaee, product lead for reCaptcha, “Everyone has failed a Captcha,” but from now on, users will no longer have to worry about it. That’s because the new reCaptcha v3 detects bots by analyzing a user’s navigation of the site itself. Unusual or malicious actions generate a higher risk score. Website administrators receive users’ risk scores, and can respond according by, for example, requiring further verification from suspicious users. This new method should make it much more difficult for bots to crack a site, because mimicking a whole string of human behaviors is much more complicated that breaking the old Captchas. Over 4 million sites are still using the old Captchas, while 65,000 new sites are testing out reCaptcha v3. While some sites will display the reCaptcha logo at the bottom of the page, you mostly won’t be able to tell which sites are using the new service. One major trade off is consumer privacy. As part of assessing a user’s risk score, reCaptcha v3 checks to see if you already have Google’s cookie installed – the one that allows you to open new tabs without re-signing in to Google. The logic is that, if you have a Google account, you are more likely to be a real person. The downside is that this means that Google is receiving data from every site you visit that uses reCaptcha v3. And what will they do with this data? Google told Fast Company that reCaptcha gathers “hardware and software information, including device and application data” and that this data was used only “to fight spam and abuse.” They claim that data won’t be used to target advertising to users. As of yet, Google’s Terms of Service does not include any language about reCaptcha. Once again, consumers have nothing more than the good word of the corporation to trust when it comes to their privacy."

  "reddit": "Unlike more established industries, the ‘’Cryptospace’’ is a pretty specific industry. With the way the space is moving forward, it appears to me that we’re experiencing a similar scenario with what has happened with the rise of personal computers back in the early ’80s or with internet technologies in the 90’s. Technically speaking, throughout history, having a strong community has always played an important role and an intrinsic part in how humans come together to share ideas, collaborate and align themselves with each other to incorporate a common identity. Therefore, I believe that a majority of Crypto projects will not gain any traction, if they fail to rally a community of loyal followers fans, committed to their cause. A crypto-startup will not succeed without the help of industry colleagues or communities. Here's a list of projects that are trying their best to build a Blockchain Community: Ethereum - Has the respect of millions of developers around the world, looking to build decentralized applications on top of a trusted blockchain network. Having launched back in 2015 , Ethereum has attracted a lot of attention from people all over the world, making it the to-go project for enthusiasts looking to develop decentralized applications. Having somewhat a first mover advantage, Ethereum has grown to a size where there’s enough like-minded people supporting a vibrant community Steemit - The most popular blockchain social network that has proven itself amongst other alternatives, simply due to the staggering amounts of tokens that have been distributed rewards among its community. This platform can be referred to as incentivized social media networks, that rewards active community participant through a Blockchain-based platform. The Steemit community continues to grow in size, making it an immediate success, even outside of the crypto community, quickly gaining a reputation as a leading self-governed social network Noia Network - The whole project involves around the idea of decentralizing the internet, rather tech-driven initiative which has captured the intention of tech giants such as Microsoft and Cisco. Using blockchain to further make the internet more programmable by creating a global software defined Network on the public internet and essentially, being a Content delivery network. Noia not only want’s to decentralized the internet but also make its more efficient and faster - a cause that the digital community can rally behind. Brave - Not only a privacy-focused internet browser, Brave is looking to pay its users for browsing the internet, and looking at Advertisements. Coming into existence back in 2017, Brave has managed to gain the support of its community due to its quite straight-forward value proposition. With over 6 millions users, Brave wants to donate BAT to websites, using a blockchain to let users establish a new kind of financial relationship with publishers and advertisers To build a Crypto community that becomes the ‘’building block’’ of any project, it’s important to understand the motivation behind what a project is set out do. Hence I believe blockchain startup need to emerged with a novel blockchain use case that incentives its community to participate and contribute. But before this can happen, it’s important you have a good cause, initiative or a vision that people can support and rally to. Do you have any projects that you would like to recommend or that you believe will win the support of the community? Leave a Comment below and state your reasons why"

The big alt hype started in 2016 (not 2017 for you noobs) when people diversified from BTC to ETH, Dash, XMR, Zcoin, Zcash etc. It was thought that Bitcoin wont be useful as a currency for as long as the a number of core devs refused to increase the block size. Coinbase added ETH in mid 2016 because they felt that it would challenge BTC. The CEO openly said BTC broke his heart because scaling problems A few of the big blocker core devs like Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik were not able to get the the rest to increase the block size, that group of the Bitcoin community eventually forked away or stopped being acitve. In the end the core group managed to convince the noobs and the wider market that BTC is a store of value and it is digital gold. Alts are no longer seen in the same way that they were in 2016 and 2017. So I ask the question: For as long as BTC can function as digital gold, will there be a massive alt run? There might be small alts runs like we had prior to 2016. I believe Bitcoin can only be dethroned when people are looking to use BTC as a currency. And that wont happen for many many years -but it will happen."

The U Network will be using a Built-in governance mechanism with an example of this being users will be able to stake a certain number of tokens to effectively become moderators with them losing the privilege and tokens staked if they go against the best interests of the community. This is unconventional and revolutionary in the blockchain space with many other platforms allocating moderators with some in the past misleading and evening scamming the community.

  "reddit": "So once crypterium released their crypto card I was pretty excited and ordered one for 15$. It's been almost two months, the card hasn't arrived. So after talking to the support a couple of times, I found a few red flags. 1. First they said the card can take up to a month to arrive, so I'd have to wait until then, which is understandable. But once I didn't get it even after a month I asked them what was going on and they basically had to say that the card is issued by their partners and they have no way of giving me any info and all I can do is be patient and hope the card will arrive. Now imagine this, you try to top up your card and your bank is debited and but your card isn't funded, and all they could do is tell you \"All transactions are handled by our partner and we have no way of providing you any info regarding this\". 2. After 6 weeks I have contacted them again, asking what I should do, they basically said they'll report this to their team, and when I asked when should I check back, their answer was please remain patient you'll be notified via email. It's been 2 weeks, no email, no updates. Now at this point this is clear, this isn't a service I want to be using, I just wanted to share my experience with you guys so you can save your 15 bucks and not get your hopes up."

  "reddit": "I cannot crosspost because of the Discord link. Here's the original: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/cs84ar/6_of_10_moderators_are_leaving_ethtrader_a/. Here's a copy+pasta: As a moderator team, we have tried working good faith with Carl (“lead mod” for this sub) for the past year and beyond to benefit r/EthTrader as a community, however, this has grown increasingly challenging due to consistently unilateral, and ostensibly self-serving decisions which he has made that degrade the quality of the sub. Over the past week, this culminated in shocking and unilateral decisions by Carl to remove two long-time moderators over a minor, unsettled, disagreement on an administrative issue which was still under open discussion. In this unprecedented action, Carl unilaterally stripped u/AdamSC1 and then u/jtnichol of all moderator authorities and permissions. Combined with continual opaque behavior in engagement with Reddit around Donuts, and generally unproductive communication with the broader moderator team on on-going operational issues, we feel we have no choice but to step down as moderators of r/ethtrader as a result of these actions. Ethereum is about decentralization and community consensus. We believe strongly in the Ethereum community, its users, developers, investors, and trading community - that was why many of us worked hard to build /r/EthTrader in the first place. Given recent events, we no longer feel it is possible to maintain a quality Moderator team here in r/EthTrader where one individual wields unilateral authority. As a result, the majority of the current moderator team is resigning effective immediately and will work to create a new sub, Twitter, and Discord called /r/EthFinance. This new Reddit sub will be a high quality forum for all Ethereum-related discussions. It will be well-moderated by a team of veterans and equals who will work together to make decisions around the direction of the sub, and it will have the support of many prominent community members. With the support of our sister Twitter handle and Discord vectors, we hope to make a place for everyone to join in the discussion. Walking away from r/EthTrader, was not an easy decision for us. All of us have invested years into growing and sustaining this community., But we could no longer stand-by the repeated unilateral decisions eroding the fabric of this community. We hope you choose to join us, as we move forward in creating a proactive, positive community that can serve as a shining example of the values that Ethereum and blockchain stands for."

  "reddit": "https://i.redd.it/e18maexkmsh31.jpg There are over 2,000 cryptocurrencies in existence today, the majority of which do not present active value for their holders. These cryptos that present no value are responsible for a large amount of investment in the crypto market. In figuring out how to unlock the millions stuck in dead coin portfolios, one must revisit what happened around the 2017 ICO era. How did Dead Coins come about? Many of the investors whose funds are stuck in dead coin portfolios are those who rushed into the ICO market between 2016 and 2018. Others may have been involved before then. Unfortunately, while the 2017 ICO era brought a lot of awareness to the crypto industry, it was also a window for some negative developments. The aftermath is the millions stuck in dead coin portfolios. Before this era, a number of projects had come into existence, even afterwards, more money has found its way into the crypto market. Placing this side-by-side with the number of dead coins being announced daily will give you an idea of the amount of wealth trapped in the crypto market. The Impact of Dead Coins to the Crypto Market The consequence of dead coins in the crypto market is enormous. It cuts across the investors themselves, and the market as a whole. These dead coins still have their data posted in the market and form part of the study tools for traders and investors. Therefore, beyond the risk borne by their direct investors, their influence on market analysis can be misleading. Take for instance the popular coin listing platform, CoinmarketCap. It has over 2,400 coins listed on it at the time of writing. Majority of the altcoins listed there do not have sustainable network activity. Yet, because they are yet to overcome certain thresholds, they are still recognized as active cryptos. In reality, many of them are gone, and just this close to becoming officially declared as dead coins. This development is why many people see cryptocurrency investments as a risky venture, especially with altcoins. Other factors include the lack of liquidity, dying communities and projects not finding necessary adoption. These factors leave investors stuck with tokens that they cannot get rid of. How to Derive Value from Dead Coins All that is about to become old news with the emergence of CoinJanitor’s rescue program. This is a program that is aimed at cleaning up the cryptocurrency market, and help to expose the true value of the market. For the crypto market to be sustained, there needs to be proper evaluation. This will be possible only when non-viable projects are removed from the ecosystem, thereby unlocking redundant assets. Although this exercise is aimed at providing a lasting solution to the industry, it also serves as a restoration process for investors with locked funds. Investors that have put money into blockchain projects that have failed to deliver on promises. This group appears to be stuck with digital tokens that presently offer them no value whatsoever. What is doing is to help investors recover value by issuing them tokens from an active blockchain project. Tokens that have both immediate and sustainable value. The platform’s JAN tokens will be issued to victims of dead coins in exchange for the dead coins. This will enable CoinJanitor to burn the dead coins and clean up the crypto currency market. While this happens, the investor can either trade their newly issued JAN tokens for Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other major cryptocurrency. They can also keep the JAN tokens and enjoy its own value. What is more important is that the ultimate goals are achieved, which involves cleaning up the industry and restoring value for investors. This is how to unlock the millions stuck in dead coin portfolios!"

  "reddit": "Hi /r/cryptocurrency! I'm Tom, founder of CoinArbitrage.io. We're eliminating remaining arbitrage opportunities in the markets by enabling users to fund any pair, while keeping custody of funds. What is Arbitrage? Arbitrage is a low-risk trading strategy aiming to profit from small, split-second price differences across different cryptocurrency exchanges. It works by simultaneously buying and selling at favourable prices when an opportunity comes up, and requires keeping an available balance of both coins which make up the pair (ie BTC/USDT). Competitive software is required to react quickly and be profitable as the market is becoming more efficient. Our algorithms do just that and run 24/7 from servers in close proximity to the exchange. Your main advantage is that you earn a return on coins you have stored on the exchange, while maintaining the ability to pause and make trades at all times. We've integrated Binance, OKEx and CoinBene, and of course are in the process of integrating more. You'll find that it's easy to setup. After signing up: 1. Add your API keys (view/trade permission) 2. Pick an available 3. Prepare your balances 4. Ensure you have sufficient credit (free $5 credit @ signup) 5. Start earning! Pairs with a higher spread difference are generally a good choice, given there is at least some volume on that market. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback! Thanks."

It does look as if most fiat currencies have painted themselves into a corner. (And no, I don't take this as any type of certainty, but right now it does look as if it possible actually could happen) My question now is, which crypto currency will actually be able to replace fiat/banking system. We need something that is: \\- Easy for the average guy on the street to use. \\- Safe to use and to store. \\- Fast. \\- Not too expensive to use. Bitcoin has a pretty damn bad user experience and doesn't tick any of the boxes. Ethereum is quite similar, although much better when it comes to speed and cost. It is also good that Ethereum support stable assets such as DAI. EOS is pretty good in most regards, although it is not that easy to use and not very safe (although that was their initial intention).

  "reddit": "So last week, U.S. bank suddenly decides to close my 2 accounts where I had all my funds leaving me no access to my OWN money for 2 weeks. A bit background on this: Few weeks prior to this I got a call where some bank manger had asked me random questions on my transactions. Some of those transactions were transfer between people , cash withdrawals and some purchases including Cryptocurrencies. At first, I thought it as a courtesy security call just to confirm if I made those transaction. So I confirmed over the call that I was the one. But the manager insisted on knowing the nature of those transaction and wanted to know to whom and for what purposes I was making those transaction. I understand banks also have to comply with federal regulations and need to report any suspicious transaction. So I subtly answered to those questions (even though I feel like I shouldn’t need to as it’s my money). However, the manger didn’t seem to be satisfied with my answers and insist on asking more personal level question such as “why did the other person needed money”, “ what use do I have with the items brought”, “why do I have to send money to my parents, don’t I have siblings”, “Did I brought cyptocurrencies for investment? Have I got any returns on it? .. etc . After spending 30 mins on the call answering the questions, I got frustrated and said that I’m not comfortable answering any further questions as I feel I have answered any basic questions which should’ve been enough to confirm the transactions I made and ended the call. Apparently, the manger reported me as “incompliant” to the bank and the bank decided to close all my accounts without giving me any warning or heads up. I had to find out when my payments got returned and when I logged into my online profile only to find all my accounts disappeared from my profile. The bank cashed out all my funds into checks and send them out through regular mail. I asked the bank if I can collect these checks in person from the bank but they refused saying the policy is to send to address. Seriously!, you going to leave all my life saving in hands of post mail in the form of a cashier check?"

  "reddit": "AERGO is a fourth generation Blockchain and a platform that aims to allow businesses to build innovative applications and services by sharing data on a trustless and distributed IT ecosystem. https://i.redd.it/68jdxw7pctd31.png 1. The blockchain struggles to break into companies Blockchain is a technology that can store and transmit information transparently, securely and without a central control body. It could be compared to a huge database that contains the history of all the exchanges made between its users since its creation. The great particularity of the Blockchain is that it relies on a decentralized architecture, that is to say that it is not hosted by a single server but by some users. There is no intermediary so that everyone can check for themselves the validity of the chain. The information contained in each block (transactions, property titles, contracts, etc.) is protected by cryptographic methods that prevent users from modifying them afterwards. Many Blockchains have emerged and their use has grown steadily through crypto-currencies and other uses. Bitcoin (BTC), is the most known Blockchain. It is called first generation and although very secure, lacks efficiency, scalability and allows to achieve very few transactions per second (TPS). Ethereum (ETH) is considered the second generation blockchain. Ethereum has made many improvements over Bitcoin (mainly smart contracts) but is only able to reach about 20 TPS, which is still too low for large scale adoption. Third generation blockchains such as EOS, Cosmos, Quarkchain or Dfinity are trying to improve this low GST number. However, this improvement in the number of TPS may affect the security and efficiency of these blockchains. However, companies wishing to adopt and use Blockchain technology face a number of significant hurdles, resulting in very low adoption of the technology in today’s production systems. These main obstacles are: A lack of reliability Technical difficulties during its integration Difficulties in developing software Privacy issues Scalability problems Interoperability constraints On the basis of this, AERGO has decided to create its platform and Blockchain with the aim of eliminating blockchain blocking obstacles in companies. 2. A Complete solution AERGO is a new generation platform and blockchain suitable for business. The platform aims to enable businesses and developers to easily design, build and deploy their own Blockchain applications in the cloud. These Blockchains may be private, public or a mixture of both. AERGO’s core technology is based on COINSTACKn the Blockchain solution of Blocko’s Inc. Blocko is a blockchain leader that has helped some of the world’s largest companies to design and deploy true enterprise systems around secure Blockchain. Operating in the UK, South Korea and Hong Kong, Blocko has already deployed the COINSTACK-based Blockchain to 25 million users in more than 20 systems in production. Building on this Blocko experience, brings its core technology to AERGO and could also provide future services to AERGO, including consulting and maintenance services to future AERGO customers. The AERGO platform is composed of three main components: https://i.redd.it/ivyk5fqsctd31.png AERGO chain is a blockchain designed to mitigate the problems currently faced by businesses in their use of public blockchains. The main features of this Blockchain are: A smart contract based on SQL and AERGOSQL, a canonical intelligent contract engine to easily create advanced smart contracts \\+1 million TPS (transactions per second) thanks to the use of sidechain technology. https://i.redd.it/8nx8vzsuctd31.png AERGO Hub is a Blockchain hosting service serving as a public interface for creating, testing, deploying and managing independent Blockchains based on the AERGO Blockchain. This hub offers a set of services and support tools such as a smart Oracle, a serverless database and CDN. https://i.redd.it/3on67dawctd31.png AERGO Marketplace aims to enable the sale and purchase of software applications, computing resources and other services optimized for AERGO Chain. These assets include, for example, storage, computing power and algorithms. This marketplace will be accessible via the public interface of the AERGO hub. https://i.redd.it/1ecujo4yctd31.png 3. A strong team The AERGO team consists of about fifty members. Most of them have solid Blockchain expertise and many of them are simultaneously working at Blocko. Overall, this team seems to have enough technical and commercial skills to realize its ambition. The team is led by the three members of the board: Phil Zamani (Board Member) is currently the COO of Blocko. He has over 20 years of experience in cloud and open source technologies. Throughout his career, he has held a number of high-level positions, such as the position of Global Vice President of Sales at Redhat Inc or Senior Vice President of the Cloud Unit at Deutsche Telekom. . Park Hunyoung (Board Member) is the current CTO of Blocko. He has over 12 years of experience in the development of relational databases and distributed systems and has extensive expertise in large scale and high performance software design. Park is a major contributor to the development of Coinstack and was previously a software engineer at TmaxData and Tibero Roderik van der Graaf (Board Member) is one of Blocko’s advisors. He has over 20 years of investment and consulting experience. He is also the founder and managing partner of Lemniscap, a blockchain investment and advisory firm. Prior to founding Lemniscap, Roderik served as Managing Director of Caldera Pacific Capital for three years and also worked for companies such as KCP, Bear Stearns and Rabobank. Wan Beom Kim is the founder and CEO of Blocko. He also founded AERGO and is the technical manager of AERGO. His experience is mainly in the development of relational databases and distributed systems. On Advisors, we can note the presence of (technology entrepreneur and security and secure communications expert who spent 35 years leading special projects for the UK government, the Ministry of Defense and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ), (Ph.D. in artificial intelligence and co-founder of Xona Partners and iValley.co) and (founder of FBG Capital). In addition to this seasoned team, the project is supported by several leading venture capital firms, including FBG Capital, GBIC and Lemniscap. 4. Backed by Blocko AERGO is backed by Blocko Inc and the core technology of the AERGO platform is based on COINSTACK, the Blockchain solution of Blocko. Blocko is a blockchain leader that has helped some of the world’s largest companies to design and deploy true enterprise systems around secure Blockchain. Operating in the UK, South Korea and Hong Kong, Blocko has already deployed the COINSTACK-based Blockchain to 25 million users in more than 20 systems in production. It’s a safe bet that Blocko will introduce AERGO to its existing customers in order for the project to quickly gain popularity and adoption. 5. Strong investors AERGO is supported by several leading venture capital firms which invest in the project. FBG Capital is a digital asset management company that focuses on blockchain-based projects GBIC (Global Blockchain Innovative Capital) is a multi-strategy cryptographic fund with offices in New York, Shanghai and Seoul. Lemniscap is an investment and consulting company specializing in Blockchain JRR Crypto is a part of JRR which invests in distributed innovation projects. Past investments include Quarkchain, Binance and Merculet."

  "reddit": "When cryptocurrencies are mentioned, what comes to mind are the most popular ones like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple and so on. With over 4,000 of them in existence today, we want to take a look at the top 20 weirdest cryptocurrencies. While some of them were merely created for the fun of it, some others are a product of sarcasm. Among them are also those that are outright jokes, while others are just a product of someone trying their hand at blockchain development. As we consider these coins, there are those whose names you may have heard of before, and those that might make you question civilisation’s intelligence entirely. Representing all corners of the internet, and world in some cases, whatever group they fall into, be assured that these are elements that satisfy the description of cryptocurrencies. 20. Garlicoin In what looks like a ridiculous attempt, someone on Reddit forked the Litecoin blockchain to create what is called Garlicoin. It is a meme-based cryptocurrency that is devoted to Garlic bread. On the website’s garlic recipes page, it says; \"Garlicoin is hot out of the oven and ready to serve you with its buttery goodness.\" 19. Porn Coins These cryptocurrencies are dedicated to the adult industry. They include SexCoin, TitCoin and SpankCoin. While the first two are designed to be used for purchases and transactions on porn sites, the latter, among other services, provides a full-blown blockchain platform for building anonymous, secure pornography apps. 17. Mooncoin Now, we’re moving into geography. This coin is based on the average distance between the earth and the moon. This distance is what determines the total supply of the coin. Mooncoin has its own programming language, called MoonWord. This is used for creating decentralized app (DApp) coding and blockchain record-keeping. 16. UFOCoin It is easy to mistake this coin for a galactic exploration project. Far from that, the UFOCoin simply uses neoscrypt technology to create stronger encryption, offering a stronger layer of protection to the network. Anyone can mine UFOCoin, even with a desktop computer. 16. Fuzzballs Centred around gifting and parties, Fuzzballs can be used to make purchases from the FUZZ shop. Simple gifts like keychains and bottle openers are available and can be purchased with the coin. 15. Useless Ethereum Token (UET) Among the top 20 weird cryptocurrencies is the Useless Ethereum Token (UET). This is an ICO coin that offered its investors and community absolutely no value. It was clearly stated on the project’s website: \"You're going to give some random person on the internet money, and they're going to take it and go buy stuff with it. Probably electronics, to be honest. Maybe even a big-screen television. Seriously, don't buy these tokens.\" 14. Cat Coins Monacoin, Catcoin and Nyancoin are the categories of Cat Coins available. They stem from the already popular cat-themed memes on the internet. 13. The Cypherfunks This is a community of musicians on a decentralized platform that use FUNK coins to support their collective musical dreams. 12. Unobtanium This project’s website defines the cryptocurrency as the platinum to Bitcoin’s gold. It is a cryptocurrency designed to be rare. Only 250,000 Unobtanium coins will ever be mined over the next 300 years. Mining of this crypto occurs on the fictional moon of Pandora. 11. BitCoen This is a Jewish cryptocurrency token that is made by Jews, for Jews, all over the world. BitCeon has a payments system, loyalty program, marketplace, wallet, and an advertising platform. 10% of the total coins goes to Jewish charities. 10. Whoppercoin This coin is Burger King specific, and is only used in Russia. It is used for buying the Burger King Whoppers. This coin is employed for a blockchain-based rewards program, where users rack up a certain amount of the coins to exchange it for a free burger. 9. Coinye This cryptocurrency lived a short life of only a few months with no well-known use case, before being sued into oblivion by the lawyers of Kanye West. 8. Putin Coin This is a coin that was simply created to pay tribute to President Vladmir Putin of Russia and his people. Simple! 7. TrumpCoin Among his numerous controversies, this one did not escape the President of the United States of America, President Donald J. Trump. According to the coin’s website, it aims to integrate itself into the agenda of Donald Trump, and aid in funding projects domestically and worldwide including infrastructure, veterans, and securing the border. 6. DentaCoin This coin is indeed a cryptocurrency for dentists. It is a blockchain network where dentists and patients can share data and medical records. The platform also allows its users to trade products and materials, and to pay for procedures. 5. PotCoin Among the top 20 weird cryptocurrencies is Dennis Rodman’s PotCoin. Its design is aimed at providing decentralized banking infrastructure for the legal cannabis industry. The coin’s blockchain is now growing beyond that and is being deployed for other various solutions. 4. Petro This is the Venezuelan national cryptocurrency which is backed by its oil reserve. President Nicolas Maduro, who is the lead proponent of this coin, however has given no clear details about the coin. It is one of his measures to try to tackle the highly deteriorated economy of his country, amidst various international sanctions. 3. KodakCoin Cryptocurrencies are everywhere, including in photography. Veteran camera company, Kodak launched its own coin to help manage processes. Such includes digital image rights and to pay photographers for image usage. 2. DeepOnion This is a creepy cryptocurrency that was created for the Tor network. It is anonymous and untraceable, which makes it suitable for facilitating transactions on the network. 1. Dogecoin This is an old cryptocurrency that has been in existence since 2013. Inspired by the famous Shiba Inu dog, Dogecoin has gathered a sizeable community and has been involved in some major events. It is still an active coin with a sizeable market capitalization. Conclusion Most of these weird cryptocurrencies are docile, and can be referred to as dead coins. While some of them are still hanging in there, others have already served out the purpose of their creation. The cryptocurrency market is in dire need of a clean up. Many of these dead coins need to be removed from the system, so that participants can direct their resources to more useful channels. One platform that is helping to achieve this is the blockchain platform. The interesting thing about CoinJanitor is that it is not just focused on cleaning up the system, but also restoring value and putting it back into the ecosystem. This is why the project is exchanging dead coins with the more-established JAN tokens. This implies that those that hold the dead coins now have the opportunity to recover their investments. The non-viable blockchain will be shut down, and its community members absorbed into the CoinJanitor network. Be sure to see some of the top 20 weirdest cryptocurrencies among the potential coin swaps on CoinJanitor."

Algo trading overall is far easier with crypto than fiat backed securities (No splits, dividends, options, etc.) 2. Most exchanges have very comprehensive API's 3. Arbitrage opportunities and volatility plays are so much more lucrative with crypto due to the number of exchanges 4.

  "reddit": "Improving transaction speed is necessary for crypto to pass the test of time. Since blockchain is a technological improvement, its demise is not likely to occur. Another possible scenario is that crypto will become what it genuinely is – a means of cryptography. As the oldest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has a that is way too slow. In this case, slow means seven transactions per second (TPS) as its record high. On the other hand, Ethereum is a bit faster (20 TPS) but prone to crashes since it is unscalable. Both are seemingly irrelevant when compared to Visa’s 24,000 transactions per second. Since improving transaction speed has yielded new, innovative concepts, the quest itself is a valuable one. Similar to groups of companions seeking the Holy Grail, many have embarked on this adventure. New crypto platforms, as well as theories, have emerged. As the legends fade, time is of utmost importance. However, like a strike of lightning, the solution could hit the blockchain world. As the is losing momentum, what existing solutions can pave the way for future innovation? Off-Chain Transaction Speed Unlike “block time” that is unchangeable, the transaction speed varies. This is because a new block is added to the chain every . Similar to real-life traffic, transaction speed can depend on a rush hour or construction on the road. In order to avoid “congestion,” some solutions approve payments before blockchain verification. These solutions are “off-chain”, offering higher transaction speed. Usually, “off-chain” means settling via: Contract or agreement A third-party guaranteeing the payment Coupon-based payment The main advantage of blockchain also holds the seed of disaster. Therefore, off-chain uses it scarcely. Since it is a typical off-chain solution, the Lightning Network uses smart contracts without blockchain transactions. Therefore, transaction speed is counted in milliseconds, not seconds. No solution is as optimistic as Lightning Network, offering millions of transactions per second. However, there are other off-chain solutions worth mentioning. Plasma is a simple solution that composes blockchains as a tree. As off-chain validation is confirmed within a branch, it is similar to a family tree. Consequently, the key is the validity of the root blockchain as a common ancestor. Similar to Plasma, Cosmos is a network of blockchains with a central “hub” blockchain. Unlike Plasma, the blockchains are parallel to each other following the same consensus algorithms. On the other hand, Raiden Network is avoiding the bottleneck of consensus. Exclusive to Ethereum, Raiden Network is an experiment in enabling instant and low fee payments. Instead of a tree, Polkadot features “pooled security.” Validators secure multiple blockchains, rewarding honest players and taking possessions from bad actors. The transaction speed comparison shows that the platform was almost 10x faster than PayPal. Although not yet even close to the transaction speed of Visa, Ripple did take second place. Will its alternate-thinking improvement, , take first? Although lagging in its integration with Lightning Network, Stellar is refurbishing the previous solution. Furthermore, it features smart contracts, multi signatures, and a database that needs . Due to performance and ease of use, many joined Stellar in its quest. Seemingly, developers claimed that they could create tokens within a day. Besides DApps, different industries build upon Stellar. Stellar does not insist on using its own cryptocurrency – . Banks, investors, and ordinary people can use fiat, Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency. Because Stellar is featuring a different way of thinking, similar solutions are using the Stellar platform to finish their noble quests. The digital advertising industry, but this time built with privacy. According to the MAD website, their quest is to “realign the industry to incentivize truth and transparency while protecting consumer data privacy.” This crypto wallet with the safest 2FA and multi-signature support is built to support humanity, too. Bitfoilex social media presents one of its uses as “a financial platform to enable payments for humanitarian aid.” The stellar way for purchasing art, digital content, music streaming, VOD films, books, or event tickets. In this case, artists created Kult for other artists as a cultural exchange. The final goal of Kult is to become a crypto cultural bank of the future. Seemingly, this is an altruistic solution for providing help to immigrants. SureRemit is reconnecting them with merchants that provide services for their families back home. By enabling payments with crypto, they help them cope with the situation they face. A security token that is helping businesses. Even though it is from Germany, the secure and stable token is available worldwide. After a successful ICO, “BB1” says it will send the first payment to their initial supporters on October 1, 2019. Conclusion As the quest for overcoming Visa’s transaction speed continues, we will witness more and more solutions. Overwhelmed by innovative developments, Bitcoin and Ethereum are desperately searching for faster transaction speeds. Similar to DIY, data scientists use proven concepts to integrate these ideas with blockchain technology. The new-old model is ) for managing databases that can split the blockchain, too. Furthermore, solutions like the directed acyclic graph () do not use blockchain at all. In the current DApp fever, and are also competing for DApp developers."

  "reddit": "In the last few years, there have been rumors about blockchain involvement in every sector, whether it is about administrative, transportation, healthcare, maritime industry, or any other department. Despite massive opposition blockchain and cryptocurrency faced, many small and significant forces caught a warming attitude towards them following the transparency and speediness it brings. Recently, a piece of news made headlines everywhere as Moscow decided to adopt blockchain in its administrative services. Right now in search of a contractor, the estimated cost of the project is almost 57 Million Russian Rubles, and it is expected to take up to 60 days for building. The intention is to gain public faith in Moscow’s IT Services by using the transparency that blockchain offers. Services include the issuance of property-related documents and the allocation of slots at the city’s farmer markets. It is later expected to include a voting platform aswell."

  "reddit": "We really have not scraped the top of the potential that blockchain technology entails. The internet was not the end goal either. It was a medium for new ideas, services, products and offered new ways of communicating with each other. We will see the same tendency in the blockchain space until we really know where this disruptive technology can make the biggest impacts. I'm all in on the idea of cryptocurrency and the financial autonomy it offers as well as transparency, immutability etc. But I think we are still years away from anything massive. We have just left the Pets.com age if you compare it to the history of the internet. Now the tough works begins. User-friendliness, real utility, adoption, disruption. Let's give it another 5 years and see what this space has become. We can't present the general public with this mess. Imagine having to choose between 10 different internets. Unless more time and energy is spent on interoperability, then the many different blockchains are probably doing more harm than good. We are becoming decentralized, sure. But we could also become isolated islands."

  "reddit": "I found this article particularly interesting, it looks at how bitcoin is collerated to alts. it starts its anaylsis since January 2017. before this, they found that alts were not particularly correlated to btc. https://hackernoon.com/cryptoasset-correlation-analysis-2018-data-and-historical-trends-a9438ea45efe synopsis: A few observations from the first half of 2018, or phases 1–7: - Just prior to the 2018 bear market, the majority of cryptoassets had either no correlations to Bitcoin or were negatively correlated (90 day returns). - Cryptoassets coupled with Bitcoin at an incredible rate during Phase 1 (Jan 6–31). The bear market begins. - Correlations between cryptoassets and Bitcoin continue to increase at a rapid pace from Phase 1–3 (January to April). - In Phase 4 (April), the correlation trend changes and sideways movement emerges. A few cryptoassets begin to decouple slightly. This continues into phase 7. - With the exception of phase 4, Bitcoin consistently out performs the majority of the cryptoasset market. - BNB and ZRX were a few assets that held low correlations to Bitcoin throughout the analysis. Funds had the ability to weight their portfolios with these assets to reduce risk in 2018 (and beat the market by a large margin). - Cryptoasset correlation patterns during the 2018 bear market are similar to ones in the past. Correlations spike upward at the beginning of a market reversal, bull to bear, and remain tightly correlated to Bitcoin until the next bull run. my thoughts reading the artilce - The correlation to some particular coins raises eyebrows. and with my tin foil hat on, might have something to do with tether. how? i dont know, they are a centralised mint, we dont know what they do with new teather. it sure as hell isnt backed 1:1 USD, i think everyone can agree on that. - as a trader, prob good to use dai as a safe haven as the market is clearly manipulated by the prices you see today, every alt every coin, if btc has a dump everything goes down. so take profits in dai after a good bull run. buy more when its bad etc"

  "reddit": "Today is a 1-year anniversary since I’ve joined Reddit and took part in this wonderful community that heavily contributed to my current passion in the blockchain technology. This from a couple of days ago gave me mixed feelings, so I thought maybe it’s interesting to have a conversation about my personal journey in this industry and how I’m currently contributing. Maybe this will motivate others to do the same and pursue a career in something that they’re passionate about. It all started for me in 2016 when I started reading about the blockchain tech and I got hooked right away. I was using darknet with BTC in 2013 but never researched the tech behind it until 3 years later. As someone who intrinsically hates banks (I’m a war refugee, and I’m convinced that banks have a big stake in warfare), decentralization seemed like the only way we could provide a brighter future for ourselves and future generations. I started buying more crypto, mining, and trading but I didn’t feel like I was contributing enough. So, after my graduation in 2017 (in Marketing) I decided that I only want to work for a blockchain company, and after several months it paid off. Although I had no professional experience, my passion for crypto was glowing during the first interview and I got hired on the spot as a Content Creator. A month ago, I started working for my 3rd blockchain company as a Community Manager and I couldn’t be happier.

  "reddit": "3 of the top 20 projects are exchange tokens. 3 of them are Bitcoin clones. 1 is an Ethereum clone. Before I go further, I'll mention this: I don't think we'll have another nonsensical bull run that will lead to the entire market going up. I think the bubble has popped for real, and that we're close enough to adoption territory that the trash will helplessly slip into oblivion while projects that are able to generate organic demand will naturally insert themselves in our daily lives and thrive. If you believe that we've got at least one big bull market left, then feel free to ignore this. Back to the market. Look at it. Does it feel like it makes sense to you? I've been looking for the answer to this question, and unfortunately the best I've got so far is both yes and no. What kind of metrics can you even use to evaluate whether it makes sense or not? If you look at market cap as a combined measure of future potential and current utility, you're left totally baffled by some of this market's top pics. If you look at market cap as an indicator of an evolving sentiment, however, then it makes sense - because there's virtually no organic demand. People only care about percentage gained or lost. There is zero visibility because there are no viable metrics for valuation. Litecoin's market cap (for example) could be $1B instead of $4B and nobody would give a shit, if it had been 4x small from the start. It wouldn't suddenly rise due to being 'undervalued'. So, look closely at fundamentals. There absolutely are undervalued picks and the market won't spot them in time because people only look at charts."

  "reddit": "This is really sad for every Crypto holder to see that Alts are falling every day from last 1 year and still there is no hope, No one knows, how long they could take to create a bottom to bounce from. It seems like alts are daying!! The major problem is that there is no solid support that has been founded on alts coins yet. People are waiting for altseason but no one knows when it will come. But Small cap alts are moving differently they have not made any top yet as big-cap alts, they are trading at bottom levels. Look at TradeOgre coins like MSR, RYO, LTHN, etc. If you just open their daily charts you can see what support level I'm talking about. But with technical analysis, Fundamental analysis is also an important thing to consider, especially in crypto markets. The best Trades are the ones in which you have all three things 1) Solid Technicals 2) Strong Fundamentals 3) Good Market tone Ryocurrency (RYO) has all these three things look at its , this support (where it is trading now) is the most solid support because this is trendline support and also last time low support. So, technically it is an major level on Ryo daily chart. Mostly in 80% cases these types of patterns break from the upper side, They way price is moving in this trading range, I'm pretty sure this will also break above. Fundamentals are also strong behind this (Ryocurrency) project, as I've seen its and found that there are such big and cool updates and features (Atomic swaps, Mobile wallets, ECC) are coming the that will absolutely attract more users and affect prices in the positive direction. So fundamentally Ryo is strong enough to make a massive bullish move. The Market tone is good. Take a look at BTC chart and it is trading below 10k, which is an important support zone for BTC, small alts like Ryo mostly follow BTC pattern when BTC goes up it goes up when BTC comes down it came down. But in High cap( major alts) things are different they came down without taking effect of the BTC movement. It is the best time to take a look at small-cap coins and buy them at a very cheap price. What're your thoughts on Small cap coins?"

  "reddit": "https://cobo.com/ Cobo is a really cool cloud and HD wallet and custody service based in China that let's you stake multiple coins right in one wallet. I used their android wallet app to stake my IOST, ZCOIN, DCR and some others. It was about 150 USD worth of altcoins. After a while I wanted my coins back, so I try to withdraw them but can't get them back from the Cobo Cloud Wallet. At first I thought it had something to do with contract periods or withdrawl times, so I gave it some time. No funds available, so I write their helpdesk. Helpdesk asks me to take pictures of my wallet and each coin on it. And I did. They tell me to wait for two weeks before my funds would become available. So around that time I come back and see; still no assests in my wallet. There's an email from their helpdesk though: we are no longer servicing your country (which is weird because I live in Europe which is just European law, they are cancelling Europe now?). They claim I had to withdraw on the exact date so on day 14 ) and only on that day because otherwise my acces to my funds would be gone. Lol. So I once again request my funds. Now I have to tell them what is the exact reason that I didn't withdraw on that 14th day? Wtf... In the mean time I have read on their website that customers can withdraw funds at any time, so the two week waiting thing wasn't even a real thing, there's no contract period for staking. I'm still waiting for my assests. Helpdesk is just toying around with me for the fun of it. So, do yourself a favour, stay as far away from them as you can. It's a cool idea and the company looks really legit (they even have a hardware vault for storing crypto) but they are shady AF."

Would it be better than say building a Beowulf cluster or another more general-purpose distributed computing system?

  "reddit": "Source I’m Not Anti-Establishment, I’m Pro-Blockchain If otherworldly beings were to visit Earth, they would be dumbfounded with the notion that we call our age the ‘information century.’ For a point of time where we have access to an abnormal amount of information, we also have an abundance of false information. There is so much incorrect information today, particularly in the media industry, that we came up with a word for it: ‘Fake news.’ According to data from the European Information Oversight Authority (EIOA), around 33% of all news articles published in the EU contain purposely distorted false information. What is the point of reading our morning papers then if we have to research every single fact? Research is hard and cumbersome, and detecting false data is not so intuitive. A perfect example of misleading facts is the section above. Were you astonished by the fact that every third article contains false information? I would be too if I knew that the research in question existed, considering that there is no such thing as a ‘European Information Oversight Authority.’ To be truthful, humans are prone to error. While most information is not always deceptive, most people make the mistake of believing something that is already established without doing the research themselves. However, one must make a difference between inaccurate information and malicious information. For example, when a state partocracy uses government taxes, meant for state visits, to fund luxurious vacations for high-ranking politicians, taxpayers are experiencing malicious information. If only there was a piece of technology that could help us publicly track transactions, verify data, and research immutable information, something like wasting taxes wouldn’t be possible. Even a global economic crisis similar to the one in 2008 wouldn’t be potential without discovering unethical rating agencies and financial institutions. Establishing Blockchain Coinciding with the height of the 2008 global crisis, an anonymous individual named Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper. Doing so, Satoshi has invented the first blockchain network, a distributed public ledger that uses cryptography to record and verify immutable information. Ironically, Satoshi created trust in a technological form in the same year trust led to a financial collapse. Remember the difference between inaccurate and malicious information? Trusting something or someone doesn’t make it real nor dependable. That’s why we programmed computers to create relationships based on trust instead of relying on other people. Now that the dust from the previous recession has settled, we can finally prepare for the next one. The true value of blockchain technology lies in cost-efficiency, transparency, scalability, security, and decentralization. According to conducted by the networking giant Cisco, 10% of the world’s GDP will likely be stored on blockchain networks by 2027. Within the next two years, the report proposes that the total value of the blockchain market will be equal to $9.7 billion. For , the number is close to the combined amount of Japan’s and Germany’s GDP. Why do giant corporations like Cisco place so much trust in blockchain to succeed? The reason for this is presumably blockchain’s capability to create a network of trusted relationships between enterprise-level companies. Instead of using third party-services, enterprises can create and regulate a system that is fully automized. Even more, the immutability of blockchains allows the companies to trust the network instead of themselves. Blockchain Follows the Steps of the Internet History tends to repeat itself. During the 1990s, a small part of the internet community worked on making the world wide web what it is today. Only ten years ago, a handful of cypherpunks, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, and miners paved the way for what the blockchain industry is today. , multiple IT giants and financial institutions adopted blockchain technology, including IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, and more. However, blockchain technology is still at its infancy. We might be a decade away from seeing blockchain adopted in a significant fashion, comparable to modern banks and financial institutions. Joseph Lubin, the founder of the Ethereum Foundation, made a during last year’s Consensus conference, stating that we’ll have real blockchain applications serving real users within only five years. Corporations may choose to adopt blockchain in order to remove inefficiencies commonly found in management, accounting, and payments. A significant amount of company resources are used for data analysis, accounting, and reporting. Besides operation costs, corporate entities also face the possibility of losing or missing tracking data when dealing with high-level clients due to the enormous size of the companies. Blockchain application can significantly improve the entire process, but why would companies make essential business data available to the public? The truth is, they don’t need to. Blockchain networks can be made into both public and private versions. While a public blockchain may be used to share product information transparently, private blockchains can be created for a set of enterprises who prefer to privately share business information, including transaction data, between themselves. However, a fundamental problem for adoption persists, scalability. First and second-generation blockchains (Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively) don’t scale well with modern demands. For example, the bitcoin blockchain can only support around seven transactions per second (TPS) on average. On the other hand, VISA handles 24,000 transactions per second, according to a conducted with IBM in 2010. When looking at the transactional throughput, the most well-known blockchain appear entirely useless for enterprise-level businesses. The cure? Third-generation blockchain solutions. Several new protocols promise envious scalability. For example, protocol provides secure large-scale payments, with around 5000 per transaction on average, while yielding 30% lower payment fees compared to banks. The transactions are simultaneously hashed to the network and provide additional valuable information (timestamp, unique ID, etc.) for verification purposes. Among the wide range of protocols available, a standard is destined to rise in the upcoming years. With predictions coming from Cisco and Joseph Lubin, it is only a matter of years before blockchain is implemented in the same way the internet currently is. If the ingenuity of the internet made it possible for humanity to access an enormous amount of information, blockchain technology would make it possible to record and view fully verified information. If it were to succeed, we wouldn’t be living in the century of information, but in the century of trust."

  "reddit": "Hey r/CryptoCurrency Jamahl from Cryptohpyl here - we're very excited to announce Crytophyl's own native exchange token called Drop. (Naturally built on SLP) As part of Cryptophyl’s unique business model, we'll be listing and subsequently airdropping a new token every month. As a fellow Drop holder, you’ll be able to participate in these airdrops and get a piece of the pie proportional to your Drop holdings simply by holding the token in your exchange account. It's the token that truly keeps on giving the longer you hold it. Drop is built on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain using the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) and as such has the same security, decentralisation, speed and (cheap) fees as BCH. Issuance Drop’s tokenomics are easy to understand. Having a small total supply of 1M, 30% (300,000) will be airdropped proportional to one’s trading volume on Cryptophyl in the three weeks after the Drop announcement. After that, 60% of the DROP supply will be given out over the next 12 months on a monthly basis (around 50,000 per month). The remaining 10% will be used for bonus contests and marketing. Here are some key points: You will receive a proportional amount of Drop based on your trading activity Will will monitor your activity for three weeks, starting from now until the airdrop (30th Aug - 21st Sept) On 21st September, Drop will be distributed to users The DROP/BCH trading pair will go live for shortly beforehand on the exchange You can read more on our blog () or on our dedicated landing page (). Please comment if you have any questions or would like more info. Happy trading!"

  "reddit": "Crypto.com sees an awful lot of senseless FUD and misinformation whenever a curious user asks about it here in r/CC. Unfortunately, going to any currencies specific subreddit can be just as detrimental for a potential investor with the FOMO moon lambo believers commenting there. So let's set the record straight, go on a two year journey back in time, and finish it off with where some of the disdain stems from. Please keep in mind that I’m not a writer, and this will be far from perfect. I’m also not here to shill, so while I’m going to give you the most neutral possible write-up, free of speculation and personal opinions, do know that I hold MCO and regularly use their services. Finally, before we begin, let me remind you that you should ALWAYS do your own research before investing into cryptocurrency. Part 1: The who, what, when, and where of Crypto.com Who: Crypto.com, formerly known as Monaco. For future reference, this is why their main tokens ticker symbol is MCO (we’ll discuss their other token, CRO, later.) The company was founded by and co-founded by , , and . What: A cryptocurrency company offering up an app/card combo with emphasis on customers who use and exchange foreign currency. Their ambition is to “Accelerate the world's transition to cryptocurrency” by having “Cryptocurrency in every wallet.” They offer a tiered card program dependent on how many MCO tokens you will need to stake for at least six months. (which is vastly better than any table I can make in Reddit comments) so you can see the benefits of each tier. All rebates and cash back are paid in MCO. If you decide to choose a tier requiring a stake, said tokens will remain locked for six months, after which you’re free to unlock or leave them for continued benefits. For those residing anywhere the cards are currently available, your card will be shipped once you’ve staked NOT once six months are up. For those who reside somewhere the cards have not yet gone live, then as long as you’ve completed your staking period you’ll receive the respective card. Now while you're perfectly able to unlock your MCO once the staking period is up, you’ll be forfeiting some of the benefits, which can be seen in their above linked card page using the iPhone-esque slider button. The card, however, is yours to keep. This all being said, the cards are currently only available in Singapore, and \\ states in the US. EU is their next expansion, and has already received approval from VISA. No word yet on a set date aside from by the years end. APAC is next, though unfortunately still in the air with no comments on when. Aside from the Visa card, they offer a few other services, notably: earn, credit, and invest. For reference in the following services, a minimum of 50 MCO is required for their better percentage rates. : The HODLR’s dream. Currently, you can lock BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, BNB, MCO, LINK, MKR, USDC, BAT, TUSD, PAX, and DAI for a period of your choosing: 3-month, 1-month, or flexible (flexible can be withdrawn at any time.) The deposit will accrue interest, paid weekly in the same currency, on the number of tokens locked, NOT the FIAT amount. For example: you lock 1 BTC in the 3-month, with 50 MCO staked, netting you 8% per annum. At the end of the 3-month holding period you will have earned .02 BTC. Upon completion of each lock period your balance will be placed into the flexible option until you either remove or re-lock it. If your token bag of choice isn’t listed, just wait, as new currencies are being added as options regularly. Earn is not currently available in Hong Kong, Switzerland, or Malta. : AKA a crypto-loan. Currently, only BTC is accepted as collateral, though MCO will be allowed at some point. The cut and dried to this is 40% of your BTC deposit is allotted as an instant loan with no repayment deadline and an APR based on whether or not you have the minimum 50 MCO staked. 8% with 12% without. Credit is not currently available in Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, Malta, or the USA. : Simply put, you’ll deposit a FIAT equivalent of $20-$50,000 in BTC, choose between a low, medium, or high risk portfolio, and then they work their magic in the trading game. You are able to withdraw your funds at any point, and only gains incur a fee. (9% with MCO staked, 18% without.) Invest is not currently available in Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, or the USA. When: Monaco ran their ICO from 18th May, 2017 through 18th June, 2017. On 6th July, 2018 Monaco unveiled their new moniker: Crypto.com. Where: Based in Hong Kong, they consist of a team roughly 160 people strong and growing according to the Part 2: MCO Vs. CRO An ETH based ERC-20 token which serves as the driving force, being used as the means of card lockup, cashback, referral incentives, rebates, etc. MCO has a total supply of 31,587,682, with 50% circulating. is the remaining supply on exchanges. The other 50% is held by Crypto.com, originally being intended for use as reserves, funding, talent hiring, etc. you can see they’ve used none, and as stated in , intend to keep it that way, effectively making the new max supply 15,793,830. Also and ETH based ERC-20 token, which serves to fuel another one of Crypto.com’s services: Crypto Pay. Currently, the Pay feature allows the purchase of gift cards to a menagerie of places, though they’re actively recruiting online stores to begin using this feature. CRO was introduced the 20th November, 2018, with the intention of fixing problems we see with FIAT such as time and cost. It is, however, very much a work in progress. CRO can also be staked, either in the app or through to serve as a council node, which earns you a 12% per annum, paid out daily, in CRO. CRO has a total supply of 100,000,000,000 of which 9,363,013,699 is currently circulating. The remaining CRO is divided into five separate addresses: Part 3: Safety, and Reasons for Resentment This final section does not follow the above template, and is instead a mixed bag. It also gives a couple of the reasons you’ll see blatant hatred towards the company, as things promised were taken away. Is it safe? Yes. While the “not your key, not your coin” epithet rings true, you should know the following: 1. On 15th May, 2019, Crypto.com became one of the first cryptocurrency companies to receive an . In layman's terms this means they underwent an audit to assess their company and ensure they meet very stringent standards on whether your data is safe or not. 2. Also on 15th May, 2019, it was announced that they had teamed up with to keep all assets in Ledger’s Vault platform, which you can read more about . The short and sweet on what this means for the user base is that all your funds are being held in cold storage, even though you don't personally have the keys. 3. All of Crypto.com’s users’ assets are backed up to $100 million in insurance. This was a recent addition, announced on 21st August, 2019. Their full page on security can be found . BG50 fiasco On the 16th July, 2019, Crypto.com announced a revised referral program named BG50. Before we even begin discussing, this iteration, lets first cover the previous iterations, keeping in mind the $ amount is the equivalent paid out in MCO tokens: Version 1.0: $10 for both parties, referrer receives commission off of referrals purchases, and you moved up in line to receive your card for when the original plan was a global card launch. Limit 10. Version 2.0: Referral reward changed from being $10 to be based on the card tier you were reserving, i.e.: $20 for 50 MCO, $40 for 500, $80 for 5000, and $100 for the 50,000 tier. The referral reward would be held for 90 days before being distributed. Limit 10. Version 3.0: BG50. This new and improved referral program was both a step forward and back in that the 5,000 and 50,000 tier holders would be getting less per referral, but you could now refer unlimited people, and the $50 was paid out as soon as the referred party successfully completed a valid transaction. Unfortunately, the valid transaction part was what doomed it to fail, as this meant they could sign up, do a minimum purchase in the app, and get the $50. Version 3.1: BG50 was amended less than 24 hours later to now require a successful lockup of 50 MCO minimum. They did end up honoring any referrals made prior to the updated terms, but many users still felt cheated out of their money. To add insult to injury, the massive influx of users trying to claim said reward and sell out took down their trading platform, causing transactions to be stuck for an extended period of time. Removal of the CRO airdrop When CRO was first unveiled, the announcement came alongside news that MCO holders would be receiving a monthly airdrop based on the total staked MCO they had. This monthly airdrop would continue each month for five years, totaling 60 airdrops, at a rate of 5,276 CRO per every 1,000 MCO held. The CRO would be distributed to you after a 12 month holding period based on a snapshot of your staked MCO, with the amount decreasing based on whether or not/how much you sold of said MCO during that time. Users based in Hong Kong, China, Switzerland, and the USA were excluded from this feature. This news was cut short when the airdrops were officially cancelled in a blog update on the 20th June, 2019. The article can be found . This caused an uproar in the community, as only seven of the aforementioned 60 airdrops had been allocated. The reason for cancelling said feature ended up being due in part to the impending US launch, as airdrops are not currently compliant with US securities laws. Compliancy being something Crypto.com is an avid believer in. Removal of asset contracts Asset contracts were a key feature in the , long before becoming Crypto.com. For those unfamiliar, their asset contract would accrue a 1% licencing fee from users using the card for transactions, as well as transactions between BTC/ETH and FIAT currencies. These fees would be allocated, in the original denomination, to a portfolio the user could access and trade their MCO tokens for the underlying value, while simultaneously burning the MCO. Then, on the 31st October, 2017, just four months after the ICO ended, they announced that they would not be moving forward with implementation of this feature. The article can be found . Again, this was simply them deciding to comply with the plethora of rules and regulations of each and every market. Concluding thoughts So there you have it, two years of ups and downs, compiled into the company we have today. Hopefully this clears up who and what Crypto.com is, as well as giving you a better idea on whether or not this is something you want to get into. Was this even necessary? Probably not. Do I feel better now? Absolutely. If I’ve inspired you to join the club, feel free to PM me and I’d happily give you a referral, but I won't be including it in the article, as I said I won't be shilling. Here's to hoping you all have a wonderful weekend regardless of your feelings on Crypto.com!"

  "reddit": "Been trading BOMB on Mercatox lately and learned about Blockburn since they just got added to bw.com exchange a couple days ago and the chat box has been blowing up about them. Looks like a pretty similar project to BOMB (1% 2% burn, 2 mil max coins) but the market cap is 10x lower, there are about a quarter less holders listed on etherscan and apparently they do staking. I looked on Reddit and didn't really see anything (no subreddit, not many/any threads) and was wondering if any of you know much about these guys? Doesn't look they have had an airdrop on here like BOMB or anywhere else, they still seem to have a lot of their 2 million coins locked up and not in circulation. Is this a good moonshot or are deflationary currencies just bs? Why can't I find much info on this project?"

  "reddit": "Because a lot of people missed the 2016/2017 craziness or they didn't sell (I am included for this mistake) to take some profits, they are being doomsday prophets following the Bitcoin Maximalism dogma. So here is to the newbies and those who have trouble with math (I will be very rough with numbers just for an example): In 2017 Bitcoin went 20X up but the altcoin market went 45X up. Some of the altcoins went 200-1000X up. Ethereum went 40X up. Let's say the ration is 5:1 overperformance overall given that you didn't pick all the losers and scams from the altcoin bag. There are 4 scenarios given that an altseason can probably only exist in positive scenarios: 1. Bitcoin goes up or sideways and altcoin season doesn't happen 2. Bitcoin goes up or sideways and alt season happens 3. Bitcoin goes down and alt season doesn't happen 4. Bitcoin goes down and gets replaced by a second/fifth whatever generation coin/platform Apparently if you are in this sub you must be thinking positively, it would be insane to be here and think that Bitcoin in long term is going down, you should sell. In those 3 scenarios now (1,2,4), you need to be more than \\\\80%\\\\ sure that altseason will not happen again. If that was a poker bet, you need to be right 5 times and I only have to be right 1 time to make more money than you. If we repeat this scenario often you can understand why being on the 5:1 side is beneficial. Especially in the remote (imo) 4th scenario, altcoins will outperform by a magnitute which reinforces the logic here. So yes, if you are very very very very sure that altseason will not happen again (when it happened only 2 years ago so it's not something without precedence) you can bet all your money on BTC. Edit: After u/libertarian0x0 mentioned it I put a 4th option"

So, if last year the correlation dependence between these two assets was at the level of 0.496, then over the past few months this figure has reached 0.837. Thus, the statistical relationship was almost doubled. Nevertheless, the analyst of the publication admits that three months is not a long enough period of time to draw convincing conclusions, while the correlation does not always imply causality. On the other hand, the expert admits that amid growing global tensions, largely due to the trade war between the US and China, investors increasingly see Bitcoin as a hedging asset and a “safe haven”. Meanwhile, gold from the beginning of this year rose by 16%, reaching the level of six years ago ���� Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin worked out the “Bull Flag” trend continuation pattern, rising again above $ 12,000.

But while I was doing that, the price started to fall, and fall, and in the end I was very glad I hadn’t invested a single cent. For a while I watched the prices out of curiosity, but then I just kind of stopped. Today I looked again, and it seems to me that Bitcoin has doubled in value over the last 12 months. It also looks like none of the other major coins have had that kind of success. Is that right, or am I missing something? Also, this question coincides with me needing to build a new computer for work, so considering mining. Would you mine anything right now? Or too hard/not profitable? I just basically asked this elsewhere but if I were to give mining a go, would I be risking my computer hardware through wear and tear? And also my ability to use it for work? (ie. can I do anything with it when it’s busy mining). Does it need to be setup a certain way that would ruin its performance for video editing and gaming? (I wouldn’t be mining at those times. I just mean is the bios tweaked for better mining performance). Also, this would really probably be a regular pc with the ability to mine just because it would have a great GPU. Probably a high power draw because it would also feature a good cpu and lots of ram etc. so maybe a dumb idea?"

We have been inviting girls into our subreddit /r/ShowMyTitcoin , explaining to them what benefits they would have from being able to receive tips with a cryptocurrency for uploading content. The reception so far has been extraordinary, if not to say overwhelming! The problem is that most girls have never used a cryptocurrency before and don't know where to start, so they usually just post their selfies like they are used to do. What we need right now are crypto people who know how the general process of using a cryptocurrency works (download the wallet, sync it, get an address, post the address in the comments of your own posts etc.). Right now there are more girls who are interested in this, than we can take care of with our currently very small community. :D In a wider sense, Titcoin is an experiment to see if the perspective of receiving donations with a context-specific cryptocurrency (like Titcoin is in the context of pornography) can motivate people who have never been interested in cryptocurrencies before, to suddenly start using crypto! This could be an important path towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency technology in general. I would like to invite you all to join us and help our female no-coiners to get started with accepting crypto and receive their first coins. Since Titcoin is not an established cryptocurrency but an altcoin, we can afford to give away good quantities of coins for free in order to stimulate adoption, like in the early days of Bitcoin. If you want to discuss about this idea, I would invite you to join our Discord (link is on the homepage) or feel free to leave your comments here :) Best regards, bitcoinx2 aka. Gandalf86"

Then today I get a call from the advisor to the President of my cell phone company, I know smells like bullshit to me too but it turns out the guy is legit. He goes on to explain that on a few prior occasions someone has tried to both access my personal information and make changes to my account. He then goes on to explain that one of the times they were able to trick the customer service rep into releasing some of my personal information. I believe he said my birthdate, my address and my postal code. He tells me that he’s going to put a pin on my account. He never tells me this pin and I don’t ask. Later this evening I get an email saying my pin has been updated. Obviously something’s going on so I call customer support and they flag my account and tell me that I need to leave a message with the fraud team and I need to go immediately to a physical location to provide ID so that I can regain control. I do this, which is far and both stores I go to had no idea what I’m talking about and would not do anything to help me. A hour or two later fraud calls me and locks my account down and I regain control. She confirms that the Advisor guy is legit and there’s notes on my account regarding the issue. She explained that someone had somehow convinced a rep to allow these people to change my voice Authentication. That’s how they got in, and apparently they tried on more than one occasion to do a sim swap but were unsuccessful.

  "reddit": "Recent posts here on the sub mention () that \"big companies\" are finally thinking about integrating Bitcoin, that New Zealand has recognized Bitcoin as a valid payment method for employees, etc. Very interesting developments, on the surface. But I can't help but think the following. Bitcoin (and 99% of \"crypto\"currency out there) is functionally a bit like having a bunch of notes in your wallet that have written in them the history of all payments and people the note has been involved with and used for since its creation. Of course, since real bank notes have no such history, you cannot reasonably in most cases be held accountable for whatever indiscretions the previous owner(s) have committed with that money. The situation changes, most of you surely realize, the moment the money goes digital: you will be held accountable and you will be investigated if \"suspicious\" (exactly what constitutes suspicious activity seems to never shrink, in fact it just keeps growing) funds are tied to your account. Bitcoin and similar \"crypto\"currencies compound this problem tremendously, since by design every transaction is permanently stored on a public record. \"But the addresses are pseudonymous, not tied to my name!\", I hear you say. Maybe, maybe not. Exchanges are collecting information on all your transactions, and they know who you are. If it hasn't already, all that data will be sent to centralized, globalist organizations to \"fight money laundering\" (translations: keep tabs on everyone). From that origin point, such centralized databases can then track, in real time, all your account movements - and that is exactly what is desired, after all the same already happens with your bank account, your paypal, etc. \"But I'll just mix my BTC\", I hear you say. And now you are accused of actively laundering money. \"I'll just buy OTC and never tie a single BTC to a KYC account!\", you protest. I hear you. Why voluntarily doxx yourself to a third-party that in all likelihood will end up losing the treasure trove to hackers any time from now to infinity? Why make yourself a target by having your face, your name, and your address floating around in connection to how many bitcoins you have in your name? https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks This stuff is different than a normal bank account. You get scammed big time, or coerced into making a transfer, if you're lucky your bank will make you whole. Someone knocks on your door with a screwdriver and knows exactly how much BTC you own and whether you have moved it or not, and it's gone. Forever. Many of you are beginning to wake up to the dire issues with personal privacy and data protection stemming from centralized control of vast troves of personal data, data that people (stupidly and naively) thought would be safe in the hands of giant multi-national corporations hellbent on making a profit. There is nowdays even a term for their business model: surveillance capitalism. I want to ask you, how exactly does having transparent money that betrays your financial situation in a real-time stream to the world improve things? Are we going to have more personal freedom or less personal freedom, when a conglomeration of big trans-national corporations (to say nothing of the government) can track vast percentages of \"crypto\" transactions, with real identities attached, in real time? (For the resisters, just bear in mind that transacting with non-KYC'd bitcoin addresses in a world of mostly KYC'd bitcoin addresses is bound to bring attention to your transactions) Privacy is not a crime - privacy is a human right, even according to the UN, who anyway of course does essentially nothing to rock the boat on the matter. It takes a special kind of organization to claim privacy as a basic human right and then stay mostly silent about mass-surveillance, of the internet, of entire countries, of all our financial transactions. Remember the Internet before Snowden? It was a conspiracy, the government couldn't be spying on everyone. They are, and they were. That so many of us fail to recognize the grave danger in allowing this situation to continue is a testament to the peaceful lives most of us lead. We don't even recognize imminent danger anymore. Wake up, the government shouldn't be spying on you 24/7. The problem is not going to go away on its own, and if you do nothing, and the next guy does nothing, and the next girl does nothing, then nothing will change, in fact it will only get worse. And one day, history shows, it will become worse enough that you will think to yourself, \"why didn't I do anything about it?\". But by then it will be too late. All the dissenters will have been silenced already. You will know in your bones that speaking against the official stories will bring unwelcome attention to yourself and your loved ones, and likely will carry severe consequences. You will keep quiet. Out of fear. We're not there yet, and we don't have to go there (yet again). Privacy is not a crime, but remember this: in a world where privacy is criminalized, only criminals have privacy. It's time to face the truth. We live in a world of mass-surveillance, and our inertia and inaction allows the situation to worsen day after day after day. Part of the solution is technological, but another part is social. You have to at least start paying attention to all the little ways you are being tracked. And not just you - everyone else too. If you are a happy sheep and \"have nothing to hide and nothing to worry about\", then the usual invitation stands: please post in the comments section a picture of yourself, links to all your social media, your email address, how much crypto you own and in which addresses. As usual, I am willing to bet, exactly zero of you will take on the challenge, and that is because at some subconscious level at least, you realize that privacy matters. Blockchain technology is revolutionary, but the transparency-by-default is a bug, not a feature. It will bring tremendous problems for personal freedom and financial independence later on. Optional privacy will only cause private transactions to stand out against the crowd. Fortunately, a solution that works today, and has sub-1cent fees. It will empower and liberate you financially, if only you would dedicate some time to learning more about it. TL;DR (by popular demand): Mass-surveillance is not normal nor is it acceptable in a free society and will inevitably over time widen the power dynamic between the government and large corporations, and the citizenry. Surveillance over others brings power over others, mass-surveillance over societies eventually brings totalitarianism. Totalitarianism, history shows, is not a nice system to live under. Choose freedom, choose privacy, eschew transparent surveillance money and embrace private digital cash."

For a long time it seemed they're mining at a great loss. Why didn't they mine exactly what's needed to make it profitable, it's not like they made more coins that way. Which changes do they plan? I read they had several splits in the chain because they simply took the existing BTC code and increased the block size without doing any changes. If it was so simple to increase capacity, the BTC would've done these changes themselves. How many devs do they have and what are their resumes?

White paper- There is power in the blockchain and resources on earth are in rapid decay... I have a vision to give the full power of the blockchain to everyone dismantling high society control over financial freedom. I read Satoshi’s white paper and Proof of work consensus sha256d encryption and this entity is genius, but to me was missing the human factor. Satoshi knew that adoption would benefit the early coiners and that mining would become controlled. I felt this should be more personal and more power balanced. I don’t feel it’s should be a few mega warehouses processing transactions and charge you in a centralized manner. Incakoin is different I vision free transactions and new minted coins distributed to everyone equally with our model of mining. Incakoin utilizes the same rock solid sha256d encryption Proof of work consensus algorithm and the added Proof of stake making Incakoin a hybrid Cryptocurrency. Once you have acquired multiple transactions and age your Incakoin you can stake them by opening and/or unlocking you client. This makes it possible to actually earn coins when you unlock your wallet to make a transaction and confirm your own transaction with no need to count on centralized mining farms to pay hearty fee’s too. This theory added with 60 seconds block time on the Proof of work side of the blockchain makes Incakoin one of the first high speed hybrid stable blockchains. Incakoin started out with 5000 confirmations to make mined coins spendable but that was reduced to 1000 confirmations to have extra room for security from certain attacks against the network and 5000 was voted not needed. Currently the proof of work reward is 100 Incakoin per block"

  "reddit": "There are a lot of evidence that Tether is doing something fishy, I think we all know that. Here's a list of the reasons I could come up with on the top of my head: \\- They never finished their promised audit. \\- They lied about not being affected by crypto capital when they lost $850M. \\- They moved $850M of their assets without letting the holders of Tether know. \\- They CHANGED what their reserves were supposed to hold, from 1 - 1 USD backing to \"Tether's\" reserves. \\- They resist every possibility of not handing over documents regarding how Tether is minted and it's related transactions. \\- Tether in circulation and Bitcoin price seems to correlate. \\- Lawyer did say they've held crypto currency as reserve. Let's say the whole thing is legit and Tether hasn't been manipulating the price of Bitcoin, printing Tether without any backing or chasing liquidations on leverage platform with the help of Tether. Even if all of those things were true it does seem as if Tether could function as a very good way for money laundering, wouldn't this be enough to shut it down, just like they did with ? How high chance do you think it is that Tether will get shutdown within the next 2 years? I personally think it is somewhere around 50 - 60 % and essentially 100 % within the next 5 - 7 years. What type of potential downside do you think the crypto market could take from that hit? I see a 75 % downside in the whole crypto market cap if Tether gets shut down since it will instill a lot of distrust in the market as a whole and due to the 4 Billion USDT pushing the price up with a multiplier effect. I currently have 35 % of my portfolio in fiat due to the uncertainty around Tether, I could be mistaken in my analysis and would like to hear some other guys opinion. Sometimes I've heard the argument that the price of BTC would rise if Tether collapse, that may be true in the short term but probably not in the long run. Another aspect which I have thought about is that the market already have priced in the Tether uncertainty, which I doubt since this market is mainly fueled by greed and risk-taking."

They posted on twitter that they have issues crediting transactions and are resolved now, mine is not. Few hours later, the transaction is not visible in my wallet at all, not even with 0 confirmations. You can also see the deposit has moved to their cold/storage wallet: I contacted their support multiple times whose reply was simply \"sorry, we are working on it\" for 4 days. Yesterday I asked for a callback and they called mentioning that errors can happen in the system for any reason and that they are an exchange, not a wallet and all money in wallets are owned by them according to their ToS. They mentioned that if the transaction was to be credited it would have been now. They basically told me \"sorry we lost your money\" casually. I posted on localbitcoins sub and got shadow banned by mods who do not want bad publicity. They ignore my twitter replies and messages as well. It has been 7 days and the transaction is no where to be found in my wallet or history, localbitcoins simply keep claiming they credited the deposit when they clearly haven't credited anything. I know how unbelievable this will sound to most of you and will side with localbtc and claim I'm hiding part of the story or actually got credited but this is not the case. They keep claiming they fixed it as of 12/8/2019 and nothing is fixed. I do not have anything to gain if I'm just trying to fake an issue to get free btc because I know that is impossible.

  "reddit": "So first of all my main interest is in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, that is how I came accross this article: https://www.ccn.com/elite-mining-inc-partners-with-broker-dealer-entoro-for-their-security-token-offering/ . When I m looking to invest in a cryptocurrency project the main problem that I normally come across is that the project will offer me an investment opportunity for a 'cryptocoin' that in most cases has no inherent value which makes it very risky. The option to avoid this I have discovered would be to directly invest in the company for an equity stake. So this article is very interesting to me since it offers the option of an equity stake to become a shareholder in a company but it also offers the ease of blockchain by offering a token. For me this is a big deal since it increases the possibility of a bigger liquidity pool and demand for the equity so it will be easier to sell, which can be a major problem for equity in smaller companies when you invest in those. So my question is what do you guys think about standard funding methods (broker-dealer equity sale) for a blockchain project that offers a digitalization of the equity?"

This is not true if you read the source blog entry refereed in the article. Starting later in August, if you are an impacted lender, you will be credited your Poloniex trading fees until your losses are fully recovered. Every time you pay a trading fee, we will convert the fee to BTC and then credit you those fees each day. Poloniex is only giving a free trading discount to affected users if they choose to trade at the exchange. Thus this are only some small amounts that apply to specific users. Cointelegraph publish an article giving you the impression that all users will be reimbursed and all is good.

  "reddit": "1. The coin has a very low supply, low market cap and has not been discovered.. Yet it is getting huge pilots with notable hundred billion+ companies (L'Oreal) and the US Govt (multiple CBP Pilots). 2. MRPH is solving real problems in supply chain — with all of it's capabilities and integrations, companies will want to use MRPH simply because it will save them money. Seamless integration between all blockchains, other DLT's DHT's, existing ERP systems like SAP Salesforce, AI ML protocols, existing logistics platforms like DHL FedEx, global payment systems like Swift IBM World Wire, etc., in a simple, unified interface that's as easy to use as \"clicking and dragging\" the integrations in the correct order to set up an automated supply chain workflow. GPS tracking + QR codes + Compliance documentation = goods wont be lost or delayed at the border. Cold chain triggers (IoT temperature sensors) = perishable foods and medicines guaranteed upon delivery. IPFS document generation allows automated trustless document creation storage. Swift integration allows preferred currency conversion rates as well as access to thousands of banks worldwide. Congruence / reconciliation of the three major pillars of a supply chain: flow of physical goods, flow of documents and flow of payments. 3. Customization of documents. Digitalization leads to less handling — 34,000 companies still use bills of lading they print without automation of work flow. Huge room for error and loss of data. A study was done by IBM that there are 40 points of handling for an item being shipped - no central management system. Morpheus Network harmonizes the flow of documents with it's digital fingerprints that, by default, reconciles an entire supply chain worth of documents that originate from disparate, independent systems. Revolutionary! 4. International payment relief for enterprises. Right now there are bottlenecks and high fees when trying to move funds across borders and especially currencies. MRPH will allow company to deal directly peer to peer and thus eliminate the middleman for a much lower fee (1%). All in all, MRPH just saves businesses money in every avenue and process that they must leverage to sell their products and make a profit. Companies do not need to own a single MRPH to use the platform. Therefore there are no barriers to entry, be it regulatory restrictions or logistical headaches to acquire tokens. And yet the token powers the platform at the same time -- as it must be transacted on the backend of every event that occurs along the automated workflows. The MRPH token is absolutely vital for every process -- and yet the enterprise won't even know what a MRPH is if they are uninterested. But all this revolutionary tech and ease of adoption is not necessarily what is most exciting about the project for me as a crypto investor. A project behind a token can have the best technology and make $100s of millions in revenue and yet the token could still be worthless. The most exciting thing about Morpheus Network is future masternode revenue share. Token holders who have enough MRPH and operate a node will be given a share of annual platform revenue directly from the company. Every other masternode I know of, save a few sketchy IEOs, pays Masternodes nothing but block rewards. I have come to understand that this is a non-value adding mechanism that plays a key role in maintaining a decentralized ecosystem. But it does not make the tokens you earn via mining more valuable. Imagine if you ran a masternode and got a share of revenue that the project earned that quarter rather than measley block rewards. Instead of hoping the tokens you mine gain in market price someday - the amount of tokens you are paid actually drives the price of the token! Imagine revenue in the hundreds of millions, and a node earning 5x the value of the node itself. This is simple math -- the ROI would be insane, savvy investors will buy the token up to a price where ROI is more like 5%... Driving the price of the token to 100x current value and beyond. This masternode model is the best in crypto. Revenue projections will fuel speculation. The rare occurrence of the success of a crypto company directly correlating to the value of the token. This post is missing a lot of resources to support my claims so I encourage everyone to DYOR, watch the platform demos and AMAs, read the medium articles and see for yourself."

Pointing the lead dev at the exploited blocks, all the it generates even on other algorithms, and still getting told \"everything is fine kid!\" should be noted by services that may be affected by this. Although my time is very limited currently there is always enough time to take a quick look at my favorite snake oil project Vergecurrency. Currently ranked around CMC 70 still one of the bigger projects, and basically a prime example how inferior tech, copy paste, some teenie style hype and false promises still lead to mulitmillion dollar valued coins. A quick look at the block explorer was enough: one entity overtook the X17 mining algorithm months ago. See here: The publicly known pools do not find blocks on this algorithm anymore. What is happening? An unknown entity mines very fast subsequent blocks up to the current limit (6 blocks in 6 seconds is maximum I observed) on three different addresses. Since these mined blocks are special it is very easy to track how many blocks are mined every day by this entity: You see the 0 XVG in the mining output transaction? All lead here: Take a quick look on the timeframe of the possible 500tx viewable in this explorer, calculate profit in 24hour with exploiting XVG. You also see these fast subsequent blocks are a pattern, no coincidence. \\570 blocks a day, mean 416.100XVG, or at current rates \\2.300$ a day. Here is a list of the three addresses that are used for exploiting X17: ( 10135842.1 XVG so far ) ( 10137386.2 XVG so far ) ( 10016095.5 XVG so far ) So in total the attacker silently mined 30.289.000 XVG over 2+ months, or \\212.000$ with unknown effort. I can just assume all algorithms are vulnerable but the attacker wants to make profit and fly under the radar. Stay safe and don't trust shiny whitepapers, fabulous advertising or snake oil community updates. Just trust the unfiltered underlying tech. Also dive your own favorite projects chain. Blockchains are awesome! :) Edit: a XVG official commented trying to damage control. The link explaining how time drifts on blockchains can be used to exploit a chain and how they are created is no answer to the observations you can make on their X17 algorithm. In fact the attack explanation in this link should be close to what is happening on the chain. He also missed in 2018 they \"fixed\" the timedrift exploit by reducing the possible shift down to 15 minutes from 2 hours. And see this manipulated block: Regular blocks have a difference between median and time of dozens of seconds. The exploited blocks not, maximum 1 second drift. I think this is part of the exploit itself. Edit2: the lead dev answered and shows he has absolutely no clue what is happening there. I can also tell you, now after they tried to sell snake oil again, the admin who noticed the exploits in 2018 confirmed it already ;) \\---- Want to tip a beer?

  "reddit": "That incentive is accountability. Unsurprisingly, people tend to be a lot more motivated to follow through on promises when they know they'll be held accountable. At the moment, for every genuinely innovative project, there are probably at least 100 others that copy their objectives, slap a few buzzwords and try to funnel as much money as possible. Because distributed ledger technology (and even more so, its role in our economy) is a complex subject matter, it's extremely difficult for the average person to recognize vaporware. This results in a market that is very, very, very irrational and dangerous. Having low liquidity doesn't help. So, when evaluating new (or old) projects, look for accountability. Since there are extremely few actually decentralized projects with a large developer base (Bitcoin and Ethereum are basically the only two, as I don't clones porting commits...), look for projects that impose accountability on themselves. A registered non-profit status, for example."

  "reddit": "As the price of btc rises, typically so to does hash rate to protect the network and be awarded the newly minted coins. But there seems to be a massive problem, as the newly minted bitcoin rate drops to eventually zero, what things will happen to maintain the healthy hash rate to protect the network while maintaining a usable fee rate? Even just going by today's rate of 12.5 btc block reward and average of 3500 tx per block leaves the average tx cost at 40-45usd with the reward removed. In the future, I imagine if btc was to ever reach the fabled $1Million per coin, this relative fee to protect against network attacks would likely need to be far greater than $40 to pay for the needed hashrate. Enter \"lightning network\", the thing that will solve bitcoins problems... but does it actually? Lets say bitcoins 21 million coins have been mined and they are worth 1 million each, and the average cost to transact on the chain is in the hundreds. People will almost certainly end up needing to stay permanently in the LN in systems not to different to what we already have today with banks. This is the go to solution for maximalists wanting to palm wave away the issues. But if everyone is using the LN, who is paying to secure the main chain hashrate? Do you really think there is going to be corporates ect paying insane fees to have the privilege to transact on the mainchain? The cost of power alone to protect a 1 million dollar bitcoin would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year (currently 3-4 billion annually at only 1014k per coin). If there's one things corporates love, its cutting costs. We are entering a new era of cryptocurrencies where some projects are questioning whether we even need miners at all! So given projects without miners start to prove themselves, I don't see a realistic long term outcome for coins that need expensive and dictative miner networks, aka \"middlemen\". So what real steps have been discussed that solves these economic concerns in the bitcoin network? I bring this up as I am worried that once/if bitcoin becomes this global reserve and countries put their economic weight into btc mining they will have the majority rule on the hashrate and start enforcing things that go against what bitcoin is supposed to be. With no one willing to pay the hash rate costs, my main fear is that a couple decades down the road it might suddenly start sounding like a \"good idea\" to uncap the bitcoin supply and let the block rewards flow into the pockets of these massive mining farms. At that point we might as well start calling them the fed. Before you start hand waving this off as \"never gunna happen\", consider the fact that this already has happened before with gold. People in general are lazy and don't seem to have enough time outside of keeping up with the kardashians to be concerned with peering behind the wizards curtain to see what is really going on. %99 of people have no idea how the money system today works, that same %99 of people will likely never know how btc works either. Before you start going all tribal on me for questioning the larger logistics of how bitcoin is supposed to work long term. Please consider this discussion for the betterment of humanity than the betterment of what ever your favorite bags are."

  "reddit": "Boss Crypto Letter To Investors #5 - August Note: Research data compiled from blockchain.info, coinmetrics and unchainedcapital. Bitcoin As Gold The narrative around Bitcoin as “digital gold” or “gold 2.0” has been strengthening in recent months and we have even seen Bitcoin slip into a strong inverse correlation to US stocks. For us, this is not a new story and the potential for Bitcoin to shine in this arena is something we have been propagating for years. The topic is hotly debated given the potential diversification benefits that exposure to Bitcoin has in portfolio construction. There are certain times when Bitcoin trades in line with risk assets, selling off when equity volatility spikes and when liquidity runs dry, however it has little to no correlation with traditional asset classes like commodities, bonds, currencies, or stocks. The world unfolding around us is brewing the perfect storm that most perma Bitcoin bulls have been waiting for since the beginning. Bitcoin has only ever existed in a global bull-market and perhaps for the first time in 10 years that might be about to change. Amid extreme monetary policies and rising geopolitical tensions the narrative for Bitcoin as digital gold has scarcely been stronger. Combine this with the fact that investors are starving for growth and unable to hit their benchmarks with traditional portfolio’s the comparison between the current Bitcoin market cap and the market cap for investible gold becomes an enticing proposition. The best part? A comparison to gold might not even be the end of the road for Bitcoin. Right now there are almost no assets that largely sit outside the purview of any single government. If we see the political tensions in our world rise and the ability of these governments to service their debts comes into question the demand for non-sovereign assets is likely to boom. The rising risk of currency devaluation, especially among reserve currencies, combined with its non sovereign nature is a longer-term catalyst that may propel BTC to new untold heights. The opportunity cost of not holding Bitcoin is getting higher every day as the long-term outlook for traditional asset classes and growth continues in a downward spiral. Late In The Cycle In this edition I wanted to take a step back to look at the global macro economic environment. I believe that we are entering an era where the understanding of economics and appropriate investment principles will be imperative for success. As of July we have now officially seen the longest period of sustained growth in history and it’s getting late (perhaps very late) in that cycle. \\-Bleak global growth projections \\-Trade wars \\-Weak inflation \\-$14 trillion of negative yielding debt \\-Unprecedented monetary policies \\-Late in the cycle stimulus \\-Declining corporate profits \\-Stocks rallying into the promise of rate cuts and additional stimulus \\-Explosion of low quality credit \\-Explosion of IPO’s showing just as explosive losses The global slowdown everyone has been fearing is starting to show up in economic data. With short term interest rates already low economic stimulus measures may need to be more extreme to be effective. The central banks of our world are preparing the global market for more rate cuts and additional stimulus as they attempt to prolong the current economic expansion, seemingly “forever”. The implication of economic policies favouring growth (including the forecast for multiple rate cuts by the end of 2019) are already impacting market prices and portfolio structure. As we have talked about many times in previous letters, investors are being pushed further and further out on the risk curve in their search for a return high enough to satisfy their benchmarks. With government debt yields, fixed income and traditional value assets underperforming the focus has shifted to growth assets throwing support behind Bitcoin for the time being. Money Supply and Risk Assets Monetary policy plays a significant role in markets. When there is an increase in the money supply there tends to be a strong performance in risk assets while at the same time pushing investors further out the risk curve as they compete for the best returns. Lower rates and more relaxed monetary policy not only encourages borrowing (creating a surplus of money) it also forces investors to change the way they invest because it damages the potential returns from traditionally safe assets. It is speculated that the Fed will keep the door open for further rate cuts by the end of 2019, but be careful when analysing how much of this has already been priced into the markets, including Bitcoin. Generally speaking investors are willing to pay higher multiples when the other alternatives available to them are unattractive. Right now bond yields across the board from sovereign to corporate debt are very unattractive which has pushed investors towards equities. Analysis The almost illogically high concentration of Bitcoin and high-caps in our portfolio has continued to bring in immense rewards over the past few months. There were only 12 projects with a market capitalization over $15 million which outperformed Bitcoin year-to-date. UTXO Analysis When looking at the base of Bitcoin holders compared to our previous reports not much has changed in the last three months. Holders in the 3-5 year bands have decreased however the reason for the decrease is not from selling, it is because they have been moved into the 5+ year bands which is sitting around all time highs at 21.5% of total Bitcoin supply. ​ The only longer dated band with a noticeable amount of sellers was the 1-2 year band where sellers accounted for about half of the 1.8% decline in that band, and a shift into the 2-3 year band representing the other half. By far the largest amount of selling during the recent rally can be found in the youngest bands. Holders in the 3-6 month band and 6-12 month band respectively. The 3-6 month band has come down from down from 10.2% to 6.8% with selling accounting for the majority of the drop. Liquid Supply ​ (Defined as coins that have moved in the last 90 days) The majority of this liquid supply is continuing to come from short term UTXO’s (traders). When compared to the previous cycle bottom we can see a very similar pattern emerge. Around July 2015 the liquid supply began to increase as trading activity began to draw in speculators again. During this same period long term holders remained unphased. This type of movement is correlated with a rise in volatility as trading volumes begin to influence the velocity of price. From a cyclical perspective it is likely that volatility is peaking now. If that proves to be true it is likely that the liquid supply will again decrease over the coming months. It wasn’t until then 2017 bull run that long term holders started to contribute to the increased liquid supply, so without large increases or decreases in price I feel it is unlikely that long term holders will be drawn into trading and the current cycle of holding will dominate. Conclusion One thing that I would like for you to remember here is that despite the potentially favorable economic environment for Bitcoin it is very important to note the following: In the face of any serious economic downturn, market crash or correction there will be a shortage of credit and a shortage of liquidity. This forces investors to sell off assets as they scramble for cash and risk assets are often sold off first. When investors need cash, they may need to sell their Bitcoin, no matter how badly they “wish” to hold it. A prudent Bitcoin investor will understand that Bitcoin is still an asset and has not yet proven itself in serious crisis as a miracle hedge, or even as a viable digital gold. . . .

  "reddit": "From Reddit User Dylan\\_Mcfomo: Elastos is certainly a tough cookie to understand, took me quite awhile to grasp the gist of what it is and how it works. And I still feel like there's a probably quite a bit that I don't know still! Sorry if this ends up being a long winded answer, but that's just because I can't contain my passion for Elastos haha One way I'd break down Elastos is by comparing it to Ethereum as a DApp platform. The full extent of DApps in today's world is pretty much just a smart contract. We parade smart contract DApps as all amazing and decentralized, but are they really? Think about it, if you play a DApp game you still have to connect to a centralized website on centralized servers to interface with it. How do you know it's the real site? What if the DNS server gets hacked? If you buy a Cryptokitty for a lot of money, what if the company that makes the game goes out of business? You might still \"own\" the Cryptokitty on the blockchain, but is it worth anything anymore if the centralized site that you need to interact with it goes down? These are important questions. And I think these questions prove that we don't live in quite as a decentralized world in crypto as we think we do when it comes to DApps. Elastos is like a suite of services that all come together to form a special environment where people can create and use truly decentralized apps, dubbed the \"SmartWeb\". Theoretically you could think of Ethereum as it's own web with all of it's projects and DApps within its ecosystem, but Ethereum is just a web that has only one service (which is smart contracts). Elastos is a web of many services with not only just smart contracts. It has the whole shebang. You have the Elastos carrier network, which takes over all network traffic. Not only is all the network traffic routed through random carrier nodes, that traffic is also encrypted end-to-end, which makes it virtually impossible for data to be intercepted. You have the Elastos Runtime Environment, which is a safe and trusted sanboxed environment for DApps and media to execute in, and it also blocks any non-carrier network traffic from entering or leaving the sandbox. You have Elastos Hive, which is a p2p storage solution for the Elastos ecosystem. Anyone will be able to essentially rent out their disk space to store encrypted files on behalf of the Elastos ecosystem. And then you also have Elastos sidechains, such as the the Ethereum or NEO sidechains on the smart contract side which are just like their original counterparts except with a few tweaks and are able to interact with the rest of the Elastos services. Then you also have a separate sidechain just for IDs that is merge mined with the hashpower of Bitcoin. (The Elastos mainchain is also merge mined with Bitcoin as well btw.) So, with all of this together you will be able to open the Elastos app on your phone, download a DApp video game from decentralized Hive nodes transmitting data through decentralized carrier network nodes, and then run that game in a trusted and safe execution environment that ensures integrity, all without having to rely on a centralized website or service. Also when you sign into that game, you won't sign in with an email and password, instead you'll sign in cryptographically with your ID that is recorded on the Elastos ID sidechain which is secured by the hashpower of Bitcoin. The Elastos suite of services also allows another new use case, which is truly scarce and tradable digital media. You'll be able to buy a movie on Elastos, in which case the ownership token will be transferred to your address, you'll download the movie p2p from Hive, but then when you go to run the movie the Runtime Environment will check against the blockchain to verify that you still have the ownership token for that movie, if you do the movie will run and if not you will be barred from watching the movie. When you're done watching the movie you'll then be able to sell that movie to someone else p2p for less than what you bought it for, or perhaps for more than what you bought it for if it's a limited edition and has become rare. The creator or publisher of that movie can also automatically receive a cut of what the movie is resold for through smart contracts. To your question about it being an OS, there will just be an Elastos app in the app store that you can install and run on your phone just like any other app, it's not something that changes your system in any way or anything like that. The app is more like your window into this new frontier called the SmartWeb, much like how a browser like Chrome is a window into the World Wide Web, it isn't necesarrily a whole operating system in the traditional sense. But none of this is released yet. And as for your question about the Elastos coin, it's there because in order for something to be decentralized and autonomously running there needs to be an incentive to miners and the rest of the ecosystem to uphold that ecosystem. The value of ELA will come from it being the base currency of the entire ecosystem, a gas (similar to ETH) that is needed to pay for all services such as Hive and blockchain operations such as smart contracts and writing data to the ID sidechain, and having a role in governance such as voting for DPOS supernodes as well as voting for certain functions within the Cyber Republic (which is a type of DAO)."

  "reddit": "So a friend of mine who has a pretty big instagram following just lost her account to a hack and poor security, and you guessed it ... they're demanding Bitcoin. Not exactly the sort of exposure I was hoping for, but okay. Now I'm wondering if there's a way to flag addresses like that, used by hackers and scammers. Similar perhaps to how phone numbers and email addresses are often flagged on certain websites, where you can add a bit of a user review aswell. And the more people report it, the more credibility it has. That way, perhaps in the future, hackers and scammers can be brought to justice. An obvious concern would be mass flaggings of individuals addresses as a personal attack, so there would need to be a way to deal with that too. But I guess the idea would be that further down the line a more real world connection might be made, like someone got arrested and then possession of a link to one of those addresses might pop up, and funds could then be returned, and the criminal punished for those crimes too. Anyone working on something like this? Seems like it would be pretty important, not only just to have but also to boost people's confidence in crypto's, knowing that there are systems like this out there."

Lightning Network, Metronome and more coming soon. , there are tiers for every level of development cycle – from individual to enterprise. BloqCloud will continue add services and compatible chains going forward. The medium term version, as an example, looks like: Use Lightning, ETH, or Visa/MC to pay for cloud storage, backed by #Sia or #Storj storage networks. No SIA or STORJ tokens needed by the consumer. We wanted to build a crypto business service, for crypto folks, by crypto folks... that is an easy 1st step into the crypto world, with the goal of on-boarding many more people into crypto.

  "reddit": "Screenshots from Xtrabytes Discord https://ibb.co/zJL0FcY (1st) https://ibb.co/sQM9rv0 (2nd) _______________________________________________________________ From CCRevolution on XBY Discord [11:39 AM] CCRevolution: Some of you might have seen the post from Chris that is circulating and are wondering what it is all about. While the content of his message is not new to us we are surprised he is posting this. We first tried to contact Chris to find out what his reasoning was behind his recent post but unfortunately Chris has been refusing to answer any of our questions for a considerable amount of time now. Here is what we know: Some time ago we discovered some inconsistencies (totalling about 7 million XFUEL) with one of the payroll wallets while looking into the XFUEL dumps that were happening on the WAVES exchange. When investigating the issue further we found out that someone had deposited and sold XFUEL on WAVES that came directly from one of our payroll wallets. The wallet in question was a payroll wallet for which Chris used to pay our contributors. During that same investigation we also discovered that Chris had transfered the entire balance of his personal payout wallet to WAVES as well and sold it. Before we decided to confront Chris with these findings we wanted to get the payroll records that he was holding. When we asked Chris to provide these records he told us that the digital version was lost and all that was left were his handwritten notes. This was also the time that Chris mentioned he had been contacted by US authorities but he didn't give any further information about this. When we asked more details about this and the payroll records he went silent and refused to reply to any of our messages. Because we were unable to establish a line of communication with Chris and the fact that we were dealing with an internal leak at that time, we decided to suspend Chris from his access to the company server. He hasn't contacted us since this happened despite various attempts made by different teammembers. We have yet to get an answer to any of our questions from Chris. ------- [11:39 AM] CCRevolution: Prior to all of this Chris had been absent for some time because, according to his own statement at the time, he was \"dealing with serious health issues.\" We have since made great efforts to rebuild the payroll history using the information available on the blockexplorer and our time reporting system. The reason we have not shared this with the community until now is because we did not have 100% proof (although IP's matched and wallet addresses are known we can not say for certain it was Chris who was at the keys at the moment of the transfers) and vague information about the true reasons behind Chris and his behavior and absence. So, we felt it was unfair towards Chris who had been supportive of the project since the beginning to bring this to the public without conclusive evidence or at least hear his version of the events. However since he recently came forward with (a part of) the information we feel the community has a right to the full story as we know it. We have no idea what Chris's intentions were or are but we do find it rather odd that he refuses to answer any of our questions and somehow has no problem in casually dropping by in the public discord. So to conclude, yes Chris has been suspended from the team for some time and we are waiting for him to respond to our messages so we can conclude this issue. And no, apart from Chris's own statement, we are not aware of any ongoing or concluded, official or unofficial investigation by any US authority into the team or Chris personally. So unless Chris comes forward with more information about this we know as much about this as the rest of the community. To answer the obvious question regarding future payouts: a new contributor tracking portal is being built which will include a process for payouts requiring 3 separate signoffs before XFUEL can be sent out of the corporate wallet. In the mean time, payouts are being handled by the founders."

POS implementation is called proof-of-formulation (POF) and has two actors: Formulators act as the block generators in the FLETA platform.

  "reddit": "Many people think proof of stake coins that give some form of dividend are a way to get a return on their investment. This is not true because all of the coins minted are inflated. At best staking prevents you from loosing money die to inflation, but in most cases you are still loosing purchasing power due to inflation because the staking pool or deligate takes some for themselves. Take Ark for example. A PoS coin where the top 51 delegates get the block rewards and most give some payout to their voters. Most give less 100 percent so the voters are still loosing. In this system the delegates take some of the inflated coins and make a profit to fund development at the expense of the voter. Of course staking has the purpose of securing the network and the 'reward' acts as incentive, people should note that the return is in inflated tokens. PoS is arguably better for the token holder than PoW because they at least get most of the inflation back and dont need to purchase expensive mining hardware. This post is not a critique of PoS or coins that use it, but information I want to make sure people have, because I see lots of people( especially during the 2017 bull run) mistakenly believing this is a return on their investment and many ICO's marketing it as such to attract investors. TL:DR Coin rewards from staking is at best compensation for inflation. Edit: Yes, if less than 100 percent of people are staking you can gain relative to those who are not staking. In this system inflation selectively redistributes purchasing power to those who stake."

  "reddit": "Hi Guys, I few years ago I wanted to transfer some money (Over 7k euros) from a non non EU country to EU Country. I did some quick calculations since I wanted to use Crypto as the transfer protocol but the cost of moving fiat from 1 country to another works out at around 2.5% -3% of the total, and that's not counting in the volatility they may happen during the transfer. I think I was able to get around 0.8% using a money transfer company. I just really didnt appreciate that the last time I used one of these money transfer companies they allowed me to run the transfer through and then held onto my money until I answered a number of questions as to the source of this income. It's 100% legit and legal and I've got nothing to hide I just think its a pain in the arse that I need to go through this when its actually my hard earned cash and I dont feel like I need to explain myself every single time. Anyway, if there was a way to use crypto on either side and actually pay less in the end I would revisit this option."

The convenient way would be to just keep it on the exchange/trading platforms online, but then i see all these ppl online claiming how unsecure it is, etc, etc. So when i read about these cold hardware storage/paper storage methods, it makes me wonder if the extra effort to keep it safe depends on how big your crypto ownership is? Do hackers prioritize bigger fishes than someone like me, who'd have very modest crypto balance, as opposed to some 'crytpoKiNg' who actually has serious money. What's your advice for a noob, with a modest budget to invest into crypto, to keep his crypto balance safe. Is it worth to get a safe deposit box at the bank, to keep a modest investment safe?

  "reddit": "I was introduced to bitcoin in 2013. 6 years ago. I bought bitcoin at about $1,000. At the time I was a heavy stock trader and my goal was to make a 10% return per year on my investments. To put that into perspective the average hedge fund loses money every year. The absolute best hedge funds net about 3% per year for their clients. https://nypost.com/2019/01/03/the-average-hedge-fund-lost-6-7-percent-in-2018/ If bitcoin grew at a rate of 10% per year since I bought it the btc price would be $1,771 This is more than what the SP500 has grown over the last 6 years. I would be more than happy and would be adding as much to my investment fund as possible! Instead, BTC is currently trading at $11,700. Which is the equivalent of about 26 years of getting 10% per year. This is why I am not concerned about daily price fluctuations on BTC exchanges. If you invest $5000 per year, and get 10% return annually for 30 years you'll have about 1 million dollars. Of course factoring taxes you'll have less than that but you have to pay taxes on all capital gains eventually. 1 million dollars will have a completely different value 30 years from now but regardless, having 1 million will be better than having $66,679 which is exactly what you'll have if you invest in the average hedge fund, or $200,000 if you just let it sit in the bank for 30 years. 26 years of getting 10% return per year...in 6 years. If bitcoin continues to grow at this same rate then the price will be $142,042 in another 6 years. Bitcoin is a digital commodity with several use cases all worth billions of dollars. Your outlook should always be longterm."

Remember it's about 7-8 months since Charlie tweeted that Confidential Transactions should come to LTC in 2019. Franklyn: I was extremely disappointed to discover that no progress had been made on CT since the announcement, especially when I stand on stage telling everyone it’s happening and we are actively working on it. Charlie: The honest truth is that no one is interested in working on Litecoin protocol development work. At least no one technically competent. You can’t just throw money at this problem. This is true for Litecoin since the beginning. It has only been me, Warren, and Thrasher. Franklyn: OK so Warren has moved to Blockstream, Thrasher is AWOL and you? Lets make the record clear we cant string people along Charlie: I’ve also tried to find someone else to lead the MW project as I don’t want to be the only person pushing this forward. But not having any success. When there’s update, I will post an update. Sorry, but I don’t very much care if people are disappointed if they expect a lot of progress. People need to stop looking to me to make everything happen. It’s a decentralized currency afterall, right? Or is it? Chris: Well at least we know where we stand. Sad to here that's the case. Was definitely under the assumption that progress was being made Charlie: Progress is being made. Just not as fast as people like, I guess. Franklyn: Again its this vague statement of we are researching yet no evidence. This is totally happening guys. I am a director of the Foundation if i dont see it then something is wrong. I have a private chat where i have asked for dev updates numerous time and have zero response. You sit in on these talks that are hidden from me? Its a moral dilema. We cannot ask for money yet privately say theres no dev to pay with it Charlie cant also say we will have CT in 2019 and then say he doesnt care when people ask for updates or expect some progress to have been made. What would happen if i right now told people actually in public Litecoin has zero active development and i havent heard anything from the lead developer in months? Ilir Gashi: Development is all the parts from start to finish, including research to coding to fixing bugs to executing it. There has been plenty of development in that regard. Is it public? Maybe not. But that's something we can work on as a communication issue KrlMrks: I think we shouldn't make this conversation available for public"

Wish my relatives were versed in crypto so i could directly send them some from my phone, instead of going through all of this hassle. The world continues to evolve and get more efficient and I can clearly see where the future will/should go.

  "reddit": "After Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, cryptocurrencies reached new highs in the world and have been progressing since. There are still ongoing debates in some esteemed organizations about bitcoin practices, people are still unaware of the legality of crypto. It depends on the user’s location as every country is practising different laws on cryptocurrencies. While cryptos have progressed massively over the years, they’ve had its fair share of criticism as well. The United States, in particular, has had a mixed stance. While they generally seem to accept Bitcoin, the government agencies are working to control bitcoin use for illegal transactions. President Trump showed a disregard for crypto through a tweet while some claimed it to be a threat to national security. This shows one side of the picture as recent news brings a new face to this discussion. Bank of America, the second-largest bank in the US has filed a patent application related to blockchain. Bank of America is hoping to create a multi-tiered crypto wallet. People are calling this a “game-changing” move, just like the CEO of DigitalBank Vault LTD (Digital Wallet Provider), Time Weiss said, “It is a game-changer, indeed. “It is a needed move for the entire crypto industry, a move that signals to the public that a new era is starting and that banks are finally accepting cryptocurrencies and ready to store them in a safe and controlled way.” A major American bank accepting cryptocurrencies might give a headstart to a new trend that takes on the market in the coming years. And of course, it will not only pen new opportunities for BTC, Etherum and Litecoin but will also favor the adoption of new currencies."

  "reddit": "I'm pretty sure I've seen a lot of people suggest a number of videos to explain why BTC and crypto is a great investment, but I couldn't really find them so I thought it would be easiest to just ask. My situation is as follows. My mom has had some money on the side that have been in a small number of stocks for the last 20+ years. My dad used to probably look at them with my uncle, but he passed away when I was very young so she just let my uncle handle it and that was fine. However she recently asked me to look at potential investments, because she doesn't have any financial knowledge and I'm about to do a financial minor program. I told her that I am investing in Bitcoin and that she should probably put part of it in it as well, but she kind of laughed it off and i didn't try to convince her afterwards. This was about 2 months ago. I now feel like BTC could break out at any moment and I want to seriously attempt to convince her to invest. I would say I know a little bit about Bitcoin and the crypto industry, but I am by no stretch of the imagination an expert. So my question is, as the title states: What video/article explains why Bitcoin/crypto is a great investment for older people who have no financial background?"

The most important thing is consistency while trading as it evaluates the success level of a trader. 1. Trading strategies \\- a part of the trading plan must be tested by conducting backtest in order to generate good outcomes in the future while conducting backtest always include necessary information like time frame, risk level, rules for opening and closing trades. 2. Trading procedure\\- Its the most important part of the trading plan that includes when will you analyze the market? When will you evaluate daily trades? When will you monitor the market so that you can make a trade? 3. Trade like a bot, don't be influenced by your own emotions, just take a look at the charts and sentiments of the market and analyze on the basis of that not with that what your heart says to do. 4. Read some books on money management trading system principles. 5. Trade-in discipline, prepare yourself mentally, have self-confidence. If you prepare with these points, you can basically tackle any hard situations. 6. Record and track your trades, analyze them what mistakes you have done, those should not be repeated. So trading plan not only consists of only trading knowledge but the idea is to prepare yourselves with knowledge and emotionally to tackle any situation. So a good trading plan helps you to make informed decisions as well as to cut your losses in trading."

  "reddit": "Arrington XRP Raise Alert ! Algo Capital, an investment firm exclusively focusing on the Algorand blockchain ecosystem founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, has raised $200 million for a new fund dubbed Algo VC Fund. The company said in an announcement on Tuesday that those who committed include investors like NEO blockchain’s NGC Ventures, TechCrunch founder’s Arrington XRP Capital and tzero investor 11-11 Ventures, among others. Though set up as an independent entity separate from the Algorand Foundation and Algorand LLC, which oversee the development of the Algorand blockchain, Algo Capital invests exclusively on projects within the Algorand economy. https://i.redd.it/yls8z8r700j31.png The firm said the fund will focus on projects that are building applications and infrastructure on Algorand to accelerate the adoption of the blockchain’s native cryptocurrency Algo as a means of payment. “Our investment approach specifically targets companies that are creating the next great blockchain applications and infrastructure solutions, and as a result, helping to speed blockchain adoption and bring millions of new users into the Algorand network,” Algo Capital’s founder and managing partner Arul Murugan said in the statement. The firm added it received all commitments to the fund in the Algo crypto, which will be the primary method for all capital calls. An undisclosed portion of its capital investments are also comprised of Algo to let portfolio companies use the cryptocurrency as a means of payment. The fund’s launch comes months after the Algorand Foundation raised around $60 million via an auction. In October last year, the project raised $62 million in a private sale. TLDR on Algorand’s Layer-1 Strategy. Fungible Tokens and Atomic Multi-Party Transfers https://i.redd.it/d3wfs5xc00j31.png Update 1 tells us that Fungible tokens are now possible. This is essentially a breakthrough for dApps, Smart Contracts, and ERC-20's Update 2 tells us that Atomic Multi Party Transfers are now possible Atomic swaps can now execute within 5 seconds through a single transaction. Therefore there won't be any more Timelocks, waiting for confirmation times, or deposits. A Boost to Algo DEX Speeds and Security DEX's will be many times faster, secure, and DDOs resistant. This would make ordinary DEX's literally execute multiple trades within a couple of seconds. I'm very certain Algorand will be the True DEX Platform ahead of Ethereum if things roll out correctly. Say Goodbye to CryptoKitties like network-clogs Since transactions can be batched together - and a pool of tokens wants to distribute to eg 500 participants, ALL OF THIS CAN BE CODED INTO ONE SINGLE TRANSACTION which happens simultaneously thanks to the Atomic Swap Updates. https://i.redd.it/366ey9v420j31.png Let's put these into scenarios to better elaborate. \\#1 Consider wanting to send 5000 ALGO to somebody and to receive eg 5500 AUSD (ALGO Stablecoin) in return. This is done in ONE single transaction as a swap. Directly. No separate transactions for both. \\#2 Consider kicking off a crowdfunding initiative on Algorand, this can be done by sending hundreds of different currencies so that the fundraising goal is met. No need for converting tokens to ALGO from a CEX to send for the token sale.. INSTEAD - You can convert ANY token on the ALGORAND BLOCKCHAIN directly into ALGO - Back and Forth within something like.. 5 Seconds? WITHOUT USING A CENTRALIZED EXCHANGE AGAIN. THE TAKEAWAYS Non Fungible Tokens (NFT's) are coming next ON LAYER 1 This means that all \"Games\" like CryptoKitties can switch over to Algorand without the need for 100,000x of Transactions network clogging it. ALL of this can be pre-programmed into a few transactions instead of separate for each event. This is CRAZY news if you ask me. Algorand is proving security, compatibility, resilient smart contracts, with faster transaction times, MULTI PAYMENTS, dApp acceleration, DEX 10x Acceleration.. Think about how this will impact DEFI. I took the time to break down their recent article, and also taken the information from Coindesk."

Let's take Tezos as an example: It's pretty simple just import your wallet balance: =CRYPTOBALANCE(“XTZ”,“Your wallet address”, $A$1) Then substract your initial holdings - wallet balance = Staking Rewards. To refresh the balance just change cell A1. That's it, hope it helps."

All the revolutionary minds behind this technology turned into sellouts because you're hoping to get rich quick with a shiny lambo and become part of the problem that we were supposed to solve. How about you start adding value to projects you love and helping with adoption? Because, trust me, there is almost NONE. Show me one Dapp that is user friendly for normies to use, I dare you. We should have dapps that don’t require the user to make transactions for every little engagement they have with the website. The fact that this is happening at scale means that are too few marketers in this space that understand human behavior. Yes, marketers, WE NEED YOU TOO. So start speaking up. Ethereum, the only one that I had hopes for, is still struggling with scalability and Vitalik doesn’t seem to have an answer which is very worrying. All the other legit blockchain platforms like Lisk, Ark, Icon and thousands of others are falling behind with zero marketing or partnerships. Why are they not offering incentives for developers and entrepreneurs to build projects on? If they would just offer grants of their native token, the dapps on the platforms would rise. You’re creating money out of thin air FFS, why not give it out to boost adoption? Seriously, get your heads out of your asses if you care about decentralized future. The only news everyone cheers about are memes, Bakkt (wtf?) or some banks talking about how digital currencies are the future. Banks are not the ones that should be in charge of adoption, revolutionary minds like you are. Start developing apps/business plans, gather like minded people and build communities. Stop copying existing social media platforms and come up with new ideas by identifying CURRENT problems. If you ask me, the future of blockchain and DLT is far from prosperous, and if you care, start doing something about it instead of checking the price every hour. TL;DR: Stop speculating and start building you bastards /end rant"

This all manually, jump trough all security hoops and pay the static high withdraw fee. Then I found Bittr (https://www.getbittr.com) where you can automate all the above. It costs not even 10 minutes to setup (if you already own a Bitcoin wallet)! You pay 1.5% fee for each buy at a very competitive BTC market rate. If I want to stop this service I just cancel my weekly occurring SEPA transfer and that’s it. From their site, “Bittr supports almost every bank in Europe” so I though, I share my experience here with you.

Both coins will have their blockchains interwoven to bring the strengths of each consensus mechanism without the downsides of either in what they are dubbing the Binary Chain. VeriCoin and Verium Reserve will gain adoption because the binary chain means they're profitable for the average user to mine/stake. The genius of combining two different crypto assets (Proof of Work for Verium Reserve and Proof of Stake for Vericoin) on the same blockchain means you get the best of both worlds: a profitable commodity that the average user can mine with their CPU (VRM), and an ultra-fast, near-zero fee currency that anyone can stake for interest (VRC). With Bitcoin participation in the consensus mechanism requires an asic miner which is expensive, not easy to operate and centralized by the few companies that manufacture Asic miners. Conversely, with VeriCoin all you need is an open wallet to participate in the consensus and earn coins, and with Verium Reserve any CPU can mine. VeriCoin and Verium Reserve was designed to have an ultra low barrier to entry for participation in the network and passive income.

  "reddit": "Just my thoughts: nbsp; The upward pressure on bitcoin will persist for the next 5 years. This is going to be a slow squeeze recession where sovereigns will likely lose control of monetary policy and enter perpetual QE with zero and negative rates. There is a real yield cost to holding cash and bonds, there is not a cost to holding bitcoin (if you can withstand short term volatility). Equities will be slow squeezed with low returns for years as they leveraged up and as trade tensions rise and the global population flat-lines/decreases. And real estate will continue to face pressure as millennials who cant afford a down payment struggle to absorb the housing market. nbsp; On an industry level we have: Libra which despite the Maxine Waters aneurism is still steaming ahead, Telegram creating a bitcoin wallet and trading for their 300 million users (this is releasing soon), we have Bakkd, TD and etrade to offer bitcoin to clients, other companies like Wal Mart are thinking about a coin, bitcoin ETFs can still be approved in October, etc... nbsp; ^ We have heard of these developments but they are still very much relevant nbsp; Stay strong and stay long; nbsp; I say keep holding and keep buying because retail has the ability to keep driving this up and institutions who are hesitant because they missed the run-up (and are waiting for retail to drop their coins) will eventually cave when they realize its not in the cards. We've had some institutions enter (Yale and Harvard endowment for instance) but there are many out there with little or no exposure. This will change in time as they are forced to get creative with their holdings as their bond and equity allocations deteriorate real yields."

So I use Brave Browser to get BAT, I downloaded some fitness apps to convert my daily steps and runs into fitness tokens that ... who knows, I can presumably use to get a free T-shirt in 6 months? One of the free apps I downloaded recently is Pi. I downloaded it to get free crypto/tokens. Reading the whitepaper, the best way I can sum it up is like this: 1. A basic explanation of blockchain as a reliable decentralized ledger of transactions 2. Explaining that bitcoin takes a lot of \"work\" to validate those \"blocks\" of transactions 3. Description of Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) as something that doesn't use brute force to validate \"blocks,\" but instead relies on a group of \"super-friends\" who are deemed trustworthy, and if they all agree on a transaction it's legit. 4. Enter Pi? Which from the whitepaper seems like a blockchain that validates from you as one person adding your friends and knowing that you trust them not to be... cyber-criminals I guess? This is where things go over my head. So you \"mine\" Pi by clicking a button in the app once per day, basically reminding yourself that Pi exists and theoretically eventually you will be able to volunteer your computer as a \"node\" to validate transactions. And you can only earn more if the person who referred you stays active, or if you have other people mining who are also in your phone's known contact list, and you give the Pi app access to that contact book. So when I looked up Pi on reddit, what I found was mostly a bunch of people who got here long before me saying it was a scam and what I find myself asking is, why is it a scam, and what's the worst thing this app could be? I figure the worst case scenario is that this blockchain is vulnerable to exploitation because the validation by \"secure\" voters could be overcome by a group of bad actors who all agree to \"trust\" each other... but I'm not sure if that's right. Alternatively, it could be a scam to get access to a bunch of people's contact lists.. but that doesn't seem super profitable or like a good use of time for criminals. Finally, maybe it's an attempt to pump and dump a new token. But if that's the case, should we all mine for 6 months so we can sell our Pi and claim our 50 cents in crapcoin when this hits it's market peak? Please explain why I am gullible and an idiot. Seems like there are a hundred new ways to get scammed in the crypto world every 5 minutes. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."

Not like the benefits of the Internet in the 80s/90s/00s. Also the premises of Bitcoin are not met as it is not scaleable and not practical for everyday transactions. In a sense cryptocurrencies are not new, although from a technical perspective they are. However, since they are more of a replacement than something new, people tend to stay with the \"old ways\" as long as it still working. At least enough people will use traditional cash, which makes it more difficult to reach a critical mass (tipping point). Because Bitcoin is the synonym for digital cash and since it is not properly working as such, it is even more difficult for a cryptocurrencies that actually fullfilles the criteria as a proper replacement, to become known, accepted and used as such. The market is so full of shitcoins that it's either Bitcoin or shitcoins, which is not very helpful in terms of trust for the average Joe. So will adoption on a large enough scale ever happen?

Github uses git Github: is an American for-profit company owned by Microsoft (bought in 2018), it is one of the most popular code hosting platform using the Git protocol Gitlab: an alternative to Github Bitbucket: an alternative to Github, owned by Atlassian, who also develops Jira. More info about Git: “git commit”: A commit is like a bookmark, when you read a book, you can either use a bookmark on every page, or read the whole book without any bookmarks. The commit is just saved locally only your computer until you “git PUSH”, see below “git push”: Sending your local commit or commits to any remote git repo, which is a project hosted by any code hosting platform, e.g. Github. “git squash“: Some people like to do many commits while coding, but just prior to pushing the code, they “merge” together all commits into a single one. \"commit --amend\": Let's say I just commited a change in the README, and then I noticed that I misspelled a word, then I can fix that commit (changing it), and fixing the misspelled word, by using \\git commit --amend\\. Some developers do that, other just fix the misspelled word in a new commit. The difference is that \\git commit --amend\\ results in one single commit (changed), whereas the latter results in two commits. Different methodology, but same code: How often developers commit differs A LOT, and I mean completely. Personally, I tend to code for a couple of hours, days or even weeks without making a single commit (frowned upon by some). Whereas other developers might commit any changed line of code. When the code gets pushed to the VCS remote repo (e.g. Github), it is still the exact same code. But coming from me it can be a single commit, but coming from Alice it can be 1000 commits. Same code but a difference in a number of commits by 3 orders of magnitude. Git squash In the example above, maybe Alice committed 1000 times (whereas I committed once), but Alice also likes to have one single commit per feature/bugfix/improvement she is working on, so she git squashes and merges all here 1000 commits one. So now Alice method and my method ARE EXACTLY the same, when the code is pushed to GitHub. But it is impossible for us others to know that Alice single commit, actually was 1000 commits prior to being squashed. Private repo’s Even though most crypto projects are open-source, some code might not be open-sourced at first, but might be at a later point in time, so these repositories will be hidden from the public, thus there can be a lot of activity in a certain project without the public knowing about it. Personal repo’s Even though most companies/projects have all their repositories under the same organization in the VCS code hosting platform, some repo's relevant to the project might not be. E.g. if you look at Bitcoin's page on Github, you will find 4 repositories: but some of its core developers might write experimental code in separate personal repo's (that might be private). Or repos not yet pushed, i.e. code sitting locally on her computer. Forks When Alice codes in a distributed project with many contributors it might be most suitable for her to not be using the projects repo directly, but rather a personal version of the whole code project, known as a fork (please not that this has nothing to do with 'forks of a DLT (e.g. blockchain)', as in spawning a new version of said crypto project, e.g. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash being forks of Bitcoin, I'm talking about 'git fork' here). So Alice codes away in any branch, any number of commits, or a single one, in her own personal (git) fork of e.g. Bitcoin, her own repo. Then after some time (hours, days, weeks, months), she creates a Pull Request to the 'upstream repo' (original/source repo), and if other developers are happy with her work, it gets merged. So there might be activity, many of few commits, in another git repo, being a fork of the original one. The bitcoin C github repo currently has 23,958 git forks: that's actually so many that Github displays this message \"Woah, this network is huge! We’re showing only some of this network’s repositories\". So in order for you to KNOW that there is NO activity for any developers, you would actually need to go through ALL forks (in this case \\24 thousand) of a repo to see that there have been no commits done recently. But as stated above, not even that is enough (the commits might not have been pushed yet, right?) Irrelevant \"wash\" commits I just coined the term \"wash commits\", so don't google it (you will only get images of jeans...LOL). Just like there are , faking volume, any developer can either manually or using some trivial script, at a regular interval just add some character, e.g. a space, in any file of a project, git commit and push that change, and then perform another git commit removing said newly appended character. Then it will look like the project has activity. Hell, you can even do this in 10,000 commits daily, \"Wow man! Look at all that activity! This crypto project is the best!\" - well, no. No squash and no amend Two developers, Alice and Bob, neither uses \\git squash\\, but Alice uses \\git commit --amend\\ to fix typos an other smaller changes, but Bob does not. Since neither uses \\git squash\\, over a long period of time this might result in a huge difference in the number of commits. Rebase vs Merge When Alice and Bob, working in the same repo, wants to merge together their different features they have been working on, they can do so by using two different methods, either \\git merge\\ or \\git rebase\\, they former results in one extra commit, a commit of the merge event itself, whereas the latter does not result in any extra commit. These are different styles of working and often debated which is to prefer. Over a long period of time this might result in a huge difference in the number of commits. More LoC, worse LoC = Lines of Code. The more lines of code, the worse, okay. Many LoC is NOT at all, in any way, a good thing. The theoretically (however, of course, impossible) best code base, is the code base with 0 lines of code. It is trivial to maintain, you just have to do... nothing. It contains NO bugs. Code is in its natural state buggy. So many commits ADDING new code are not always good. Better with commits removing code, given the same functionality. \"But but but... how can I easily determine which crypto project is best by looking at Gitlab/Bitbucket/Github?\" Well you can't, that is my point. But if you want some tips of what to look for, using these metrics are actually relevant: 1. Number of contributors 2. Number of forks 3. Number of stars 4. Number of pull requests (PR for short, called \"Merge Request\" in Gitlab), and how many of them are open? How fast does a PR get merged? 5. Last commit date: WARNING for false positives! Remember \"wash commits\" (mentioned above), if the last commit date is recent, it does NOT necessarilty mean that the project is active, have a look at the commit. Does it look trivial or not? A trivial commit is e.g. a commit adding a newline/space in the README."

But so what? Literally every other transparent crypto is too. Consider these 4 massive advantages of the Libra: - Massive fiat gateway to crypto - Tradeable on regular exchanges - Pushes payment processors to accept crypto - Legitimizes cryptocurrency These are advantages that directly benefit us. It also lets people easily send money internationally, get used to cryptocurrencies, and have wallets on their own computers and mobile devices. This is huge potential to crypto, and it remains painfully obvious how much better the other coins are as well so they can swap."

Open Equity (or OEF) was built with the purpose of allowing anyone, anywhere in the world to start a company and purchase equity in a company by allowing peer-to-peer transactions between founder and investor. With OEF, founders can outsource the elitist and exclusive culture of venture capital and private equity markets to the general public. Currently, average investors can only buy equity in a company if it has ‘gone public’ and is listed on a registered exchange. Still, barriers to entry exists, such as geography—it is often to difficult to access a foreign country’s stock market— and high stock prices—even if a lower-middle class family in Indonesia has access to Amazon stock, for example, the price and the coinciding requirement to buy an entire share prevents some investors from entering the market. With our open source application, we aim to bypass these barriers. Further, we hope to democratize access to equity markets. To purchase equity in a company on the OEF platform, the investor will purchase ERC-20 tokens that will represent equity in the company. The investor will be provided with an easily navigable interface in which it takes just a few clicks to purchase equity. No minimums, no daily maximums, no formal identification required. How is this open source software maintained? The Open Equity Foundation, a non-profit foundation that aids in the development of OEF, will openly provide governance tokens to those who wish to contribute to OEF and its development. Contributions are allocated to two separate funds: one fund that purely covers operational costs of OEF foundation members to execute development of OEF one fund in which proceeds will be held in reserve for bounty completion - when someone wants a certain feature on the app, they can pay a bounty for a developer to complete that feature. We welcome any questions! And we need help from especially front end developers to help us create a slick, user-friendly website. Link to our white paper:"

  "reddit": "Constellation tackles big data and blockchain with the U.S. Air Force Constellation Network signs deal to provide solutions around interoperability between legacy infrastructure and emerging data technology SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 27, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Constellation Network Inc., a San Francisco based technology and blockchain company signed a working contract with the United States Air Force (USAF). The contract is part of the USAF SBIR Phase I program that provides the rails to a solution fully integrated with Air Force constituents. USAF STATEMENT - \"AFRL and AFWERX have partnered to streamline the Small Business Innovation Research process in an attempt to speed up the experience, broaden the pool of potential applicants and decrease bureaucratic overhead. Beginning in SBIR 18.2, and now in 19.2, the Air Force has begun offering 'Special' SBIR topics that are faster, leaner and open to a broader range of innovations.\" \"It's a match at the right time with the right partner,\" agrees Benjamin Diggles, VP of Business Development at Constellation. He confirms: \"the USAF has a multitude of data sources like drones, planes, and satellites that need to be secured. Clean and consolidated data that can be queried instantly is a big need within the defense apparatus.\" Constellation's technology will help securely unlock traditionally siloed and non-accessible data and data sources. This is commonly referred to as Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2) at the U.S. Air Force. Multi-domain, cross-service stakeholders are disbursed, disconnected and complicated and the data created by each domain is either non-accessible or requires significant manpower to handle data forensics, planning, and collection. Constellation will create a leap in the USAF's current capabilities with a focus on the agile interoperability of both legacy and future data types. It is a scalable and secure approach to Big Data processing while enabling the merging of legacy system data with existing cloud infrastructure data. As such, Constellation provides decentralized security not only to Air Force data pipelines, with encryption, but also creates audit trails and a live overview of the status of any data source. Constellation is one of the unique technologies attempting to bridge the gap of real-world adoption for blockchain technologies by enterprise and business use cases. More specifically, Benjamin Jorgensen the Constellation's CEO comments, \"While people aren't buying blockchain off of shelves, government organizations have the opportunity to drive innovation.\" Jorgensen states, \"The move by the United States Government to work with early-stage businesses and early innovation shows a massive shift by the public sector to be leaders in revolutionizing existing infrastructures by adopting new technologies that protect consumers' privacy, while tackling futuristic visions of the connected world and joining the private sector in the $50B industry of big data.\" Constellation is poised to become an influential player in this market. The recent attacks on centralized systems like Equifax, Visa and the IRS, underscore the need for a new approach in handling Big Data across enterprises and governments. \"Every organization has big data needs and challenges,\" says Jorgensen and he adds, \"This is just the first of a series of in-depth partnerships with commercial and government entities to deliver fully integrated and productized blockchain solutions.\" About Constellation Constellation providing infrastructure tools for an open decentralized data marketplace and an enterprise-grade software solution for data provenance and integrity. It's secure, cost-effective, scalable, and easy to integrate. Furthermore, Constellation provides data dependency graphs on a decentralized DAG (directed acyclic graph) network - an evolution of existing blockchain technologies. The solution not only secures data pipelines through encryption but creates an audit trail of data downstream to enable a live overview of the status of any data source.

  "reddit": "Technology has helped in the development and advancement of the mankind as a whole. Innovative creations have made life more convenient. Connecting with individuals in various parts of the world, travelling long distances, having steady sources of entertainment and simplicity of preparing and storing food are the absolute best things technology has offered us. The technologies which enable us to share data, pictures and thoughts among others things are what we call social media. One huge social media platform right now is Facebook, it is a social networking website where users can post comments, share photographs and post links to news or other interesting content on the web, chat live, and watch short-form video. Facebook is user-friendly and open to everyone. Even the least technical-minded people can sign up and begin posting on social media. With the advancement of technology and Facebook's innovation, they created Libra. Libra is a crypto token that aims to provide unbanked individuals such as migrant workers and others in developing nations without access to traditional banks, a means of interacting with online economies and achieve a purchasing power that has previously been outside their grasp. This is an interesting concept considering the fact that while large populations of people in developing nations don’t have bank accounts, yet practically everyone has a smartphone: one estimate states there are 2.14 billion active Facebook users. The unit of currency is called “Libra.” Libra will need to be accepted in many places and easy to access for those who want to use it. In other words, people need to have confidence that they can use Libra and that its value will remain relatively stable over time. Unlike the majority of cryptocurrencies, Libra is fully backed by a reserve of real assets. A basket of bank deposits and short-term government securities will be held in the Libra Reserve for every Libra that is created, building trust in its intrinsic value. The Libra Reserve will be administered with the objective of preserving the value of Libra over time. As said in this , the Libra network sets itself apart from traditional blockchain tech in that there are no blocks. Blockchains function using a distributed ledger that clusters data into packets that are then secured across all nodes in the network. The Libra blockchain does not use this data cluster organization, instead opting for a single data structure that records all transactions over time. This advancement of Facebook will surely helps millions of people. While technology has been classified into several categories each serving its own purpose, the core motive of all these remains the same, that is to design and build newer devices to make life more convenient."

I track it every day, and I look at its opening and closing price corresponding to the price of BTC on GDAX. Recently, even though the price of BTC has gone up, GBTC would still go down. Everyone knows there is a premium to invest in GBTC, when you do the math and figure out how many BTC you are actually buying. According to Grayscale, you are buying 0.00097609 per share. So roughly 1000 shares = 1BTC (for convenience sake). The current share price is $12.73. So it is trading at a price of about $12,730 per coin. Now this premium has been narrowing for quite a while. Why? Nothing has changed in terms of the management, quality of the trust, fees, etc. The only thing I can think of is that some smart money knows there will be competition very soon, in the form of one of the ETFs getting approved.

  "reddit": "The blockchain forensics firm that they are offering “suspicious transaction” alerts for 15 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, top stable coins, and some ERC-20 tokens. What this essentially means is that after Bitcoins are purchased on a regulated platform like Coinbase or a Bitcoin ATM, they are then tracked to see if they are being used on the Darknet or for other illegal things like money laundering and tax evasion. Indeed, government agencies are pouring tens of millions of dollars into blockchain forensics firms such as Chainalysis, Elliptic, Coinfirm, Blockchain Intelligence Group, CipherTrace, and Scorechain. These government agencies include U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Breaking this down, the IRS is tracking cryptocurrency activity in order to increase the taxation of cryptocurrency users. The cryptocurrency tax code in the United States is quite complex, time consuming, and expensive, and it seems a large fraction of cryptocurrency users have not paid taxes at all due to that. The IRS uses blockchain forensics in order to make a case to audit cryptocurrency users, and this may be connected to the recently sent out to cryptocurrency users across the country. Apparently Coinbase, the biggest retail crypto exchange in the United States, handed over all user data from 2013-2017 to the IRS. The ICE, DEA, and FBI are all involved in trying to bust the Darknet, so it is no surprise that they are using blockchain forensics to track down cryptocurrency transactions that are being sent to the Darknet, since that can provide evidence to take down criminals that are otherwise highly anonymous. The SEC and CFTC are involved in regulating the cryptocurrency markets, so they use blockchain forensics to track any unregulated cryptocurrency trading and investment, continuing their efforts to completely centralize the cryptocurrency market into the hands of a few big players that are fully know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliant. Zooming out, the rise of blockchain forensics is another step in the government’s attack on the cryptocurrency economy. It perhaps started when peer to peer Bitcoin trading, like on Localbitcoins, was outlawed. This led to Bitcoin trading only being legal on major exchanges like Coinbase where the full identity of users is collected, from which point user identitification data and their transaction activity is accessible to any government agency that wants it. Now blockchain forensics are making it so any Bitcoins which originate from regulated venues can be easily tracked, compromising the pseudo-anonymity of the Bitcoin network. In fewer words, the government has worked to ensure that people can only obtain Bitcoin at fully regulated venues, and now blockchain forensics is being used to track Bitcoins and other major cryptocurrencies originating on those regulated venues, and this comprises a large fraction of the cryptocurrency in circulation. Cryptocurrency users should be aware that a significant amount of Bitcoin originates on Coinbase or other regulated exchanges, so even if Bitcoin is obtained in a peer to peer deal it may still be tracked by blockchain forensics firms working for the exchanges and government. There are options available to increase anonymity, like using a mixer which sends the Bitcoin between numerous addresses, mining the Bitcoin yourself, or using a fully stealth cryptocurrency like Monero. Cypherpunk Labs does not advocate the use of cryptocurrency for illegal activity, but privacy and anonymity is a basic human right, and cryptocurrency users should be aware that cryptocurrency lacks anonymity nowadays due to the rise of blockchain forensics, if proper steps are not taken."

I got started back in late fall 2017 and unfortunately got swept up in the bull run and crash. I’ve been trying to hold my coins until I could even out again but unfortunately I could really use the cash now... Is the easiest and fasted way to convert into something I can sell on Coinbase? Any other options? How long does it take? Also, since I’m probably losing about $10k when I cash out, can I get some of that back in taxes?"

  "reddit": "Hi Everyone! Our team completed a comprehensive study of portfolio rebalancing. We compared both threshold and periodic rebalancing across thousands of backtests. The results we found were pretty exciting, so I wanted to go ahead and share our findings here! To analyze each percent threshold, our study combined the results of 1,000 backtests. The outcome is a histogram at each threshold which provides a distribution which can be both visually and analytically studied. In total 15,000 backtests were run for the study. At the beginning of each backtest, the portfolio was seeded with $5,000 of initial capital which was used to construct the portfolio and rebalance throughout the backtest. For the sake of simplicity, the portfolio was allocated as an evenly distributed portfolio. That means each of the 10 assets were given exactly 10% weight in the portfolio. At the conclusion of each backtest, the result is a single dollar amount which is the value of the portfolio. This value is received for both rebalanced backtests and backtests which used the HODL strategy. The two resulting values are compared to one another in the following way to calculate performance: Performance = ((R - H) / H) x 100 where, R is the value of the rebalanced portfolio. H is the value of the HODLed portfolio. The result is multiplied by 100 to convert from a decimal to a percent. The following results cover all 15,000 backtests in an attempt to evaluate the performance difference between portfolios which were historically rebalanced and those which have HODLed. As an extra resource at the end, these results are compared to those which have used a periodic rebalancing strategy instead of threshold rebalancing. At each threshold, we evaluate 4 primary attributes for the distribution. These attributes are the following: Primary Performance Distribution: The range for which the majority of the backtests fall in the performance distribution. We calculate this range by taking the first bucket which has more than 10 backtests in the range and include all backtests until there are less than 10 backtests in a bucket. Percent of Threshold Backtests that Outperformed HODL: The percent of portfolios which performed better using a threshold-based rebalancing strategy instead of HODLing. Average Performance Increase: The average percent boost that was observed for a portfolio that used the threshold rebalancing strategy instead of HODLing. Median Performance Increase: The median percent boost that was observed for a portfolio that used the threshold rebalancing strategy instead of HODLing. Results The results demonstrated that the median portfolio increased and decreased based on the threshold percent. Starting with a 1% threshold, we observed the lowest median performance of 84%. This quickly climbed as we increased the threshold percent until we reach a 15% threshold. At this point, the median performance peaked at 305%. Continuing to increase our threshold past 15% didn't further improve performance. Instead, we observed a slight decline in performance until it stabilizes around 275%. After reviewing the threshold rebalancing results, we continued onto the results from the periodic rebalancing backtests. The results for the periodic rebalancing strategy indicated the peak performance was obtained with a 1 day rebalancing period for the data set and exchange which was used for this study. In the case of both strategies, the lowest performance was obtained when utilizing a strategy which resulted in high frequency rebalances. Discussion There are a number of factors which could cause threshold rebalancing to outperform periodic rebalancing. The most obvious of these reasons is the “need based” trigger that threshold rebalancing employs. Essentially, instead of always rebalancing, regardless of the state of the portfolio, threshold rebalancing will only rebalance when the portfolio has become misaligned due to movements in the market. When the portfolio is aligned with the target allocations, no rebalances will be attempted. This can save on trading fees in the long run. In addition to saving on fees, threshold rebalancing also empowers portfolios to more accurately capture spikes in the market. When there are moments of large volatility, periodic rebalancing will ignore the changes until the next rebalance period. On the other hand, threshold rebalancing will use this volatility to it’s advantage to rebalance when a spike crosses the threshold. These two major aspects can allow threshold rebalancing to both reduce costs and increase returns over a long period of time. Conclusions The results clearly illustrated threshold rebalancing outperformed both HODLed portfolios as well as those portfolios which utilized a periodic rebalancing strategy. While period based rebalancing peaked at a 166% increase over buy and hold for a 1 day rebalance period, threshold-based rebalancing peaked at a 305% performance increase over buy and hold for a 15% threshold. Other interesting items of note include: A 15% threshold based rebalance experienced the largest distribution of performance results. A 50% threshold saw the highest percent of portfolios perform better than HODL at 99.1%. One hour rebalances saw the lowest percentage of portfolios which outperformed HODL at 75.3%. A 15% threshold rebalance outperformed HODL by 305%. Let me know in the comments below if you have any questions about these results! If you want to automate your own portfolio with a threshold rebalancing strategy, try ."

  "reddit": "It has been a decade since this market's inception and 3 years since I've started monitoring it closely and analyzing it. Whether you're new to crypto or a veteran that has been through multiple bubbles, chances are you don't really know what's going on. Despite surviving the worst bear market so far, we're hovering at a $300B total market cap. So how come crypto journalism is so bad it sticks out even when compared to modern journalism? The answer is that the lack of available foresight and unbiased analyses is very much on purpose. Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV and other clones (and almost everything else, but clones aren't as nebulous) really give you a great window on the insanity of this market. Everyone who tries to attach any kind of metrics to these projects or make realistic predictions regarding adoption and 'fair value' is prompted with a question: \"Who in their right mind could think this is worth 5+ billions?\" Since it's essentially impossible to reconcile market valuation and fundamentals, they assume that there's something they're not getting, that there's crucial information they lack, so they resume business as usual. There has to be a reason, right? The truth is that crypto as a whole is a rare and insanely profitable cocktail. The market is split almost perfectly in two (by perfectly, I don't mean a 50/50 split, I mean that these two sides represent almost 100% of the market): Manipulators, who have the means to perform due diligence and are fully aware that the vast, vast majority of projects will absolutely never go anywhere, yet that a select few might explode. Gamblers, who do not understand the underlying technology (and even less the economic environment surrounding said technology) but are ready to shell out millions collectively to make a quick profit. The amount of people who perform thorough, unbiased research and invest carefully is staggeringly low, simply because there are very few individuals with the resources required to sift through the bullshit and without any intention to exploit the market. Coupled with extremely low real liquidity (arbitrage and market makers shouldn't really be considered), this results in a nonsensical market of booms busts that benefits manipulators every time. However, none of this would be possible if it weren't for a key ingredient: Bitcoin. As long as Bitcoin and any of its clones gravitate towards the top, you can be sure that the market conditions haven't changed, because they act as indicators. Our top meme is a perfect testament to that: \"HODL\" is based on the bizarre and baseless assumption that the past will repeat ad vitam, and it does a great job keeping liquidity low. In short, it's a perfect gauge of the community's overall idiocy. Mainstream media only exacerbates the issue. It's much less costly (and thus, more profitable) for it to invite supporters or critics of Bitcoin to push a certain agenda than it is to pay competent journalists or experts to provide a detailed explanation of smart contracts and the rise of a programmable economy, for example. Yet I can tell you that in most professional circles, nobody talks about Bitcoin. Manufacturers don't care about receiving payments in Bitcoin, they care about data integrity and security. Energy consortia aren't interested in having households pay their bills with Litecoin, they care about autonomous, self-balancing, self-monitoring grids that optimize electricity distribution and pricing. There are several projects that have a much better chance to overcome the hurdles of adoption, yet it's unlikely you'll find them in the top 10 positions, because they're neither sexy nor simple. Why would manipulators waste time, money and effort inflating those projects' value, when they know full well that they'll appreciate on their own in due time? It's much easier to extract as much money as possible from morons who are willing to 'invest' in worthless junk and let the rest depreciate dramatically to secure a lower entry point. Even as the technology progresses and real innovations are made public, tribalism and hit pieces take care of the rest. TL;DR: Current prices are not indicative of future success. If you've performed the research and come to the conclusion that an asset is undervalued, believe in yourself. This market is not your friend, it exists only to take your money."

  "reddit": "After the recent Bitcoin Bull run, we are expecting an altcoin season now. Well, altcoin season has not come yet, however, it would definitely come, at least for projects with strong fundamentals, and we should be prepared. We take a deeper look at the Smart Contract Protocols. https://i.redd.it/471ms4gg21g31.png It’s Bitcoin season right now and being the leader of all cryptocurrencies, bitcoin price staying strong is good for the whole ecosystem. With bakkt and halving approaching things are looking great for Bitcoin. As we see in this image the global interest in Bitcoin is less than when bitcoin was at around $11,000 last time. This might continue till we see an all-time high on bitcoin and then every newspaper, the media outlet will be talking about bitcoin and crypto. A $20,000 bitcoin might be too expensive for many and they may look for other alternatives. While bitcoin is doing great it’s hard to deny a lot of other blockchain projects have also been a lot of work to build value into their ecosystem. Ethereum https://i.redd.it/11uvwy2m21g31.png Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. On Ethereum, a programmer can write code that controls digital value, runs exactly as programmed, and is accessible anywhere in the world. Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin. There is no company or centralized organization that controls Ethereum. Ethereum is maintained and improved over time by a diverse global community of contributors who work on everything from the core protocol to consumer applications. The Ethereum community is the largest and most active blockchain community in the world. Important applications of Ethereum include Cryptocurrency wallets, Financial applications, Decentralized markets, Games, etc. Notable Ethereum apps include \\- IDEX, popular decentralized exchange \\- Golem, a platform to harness computing power \\- CryptoKitties, a game where you collect and breed digital collectible cats \\- DAI, a stable cryptocurrency that holds value at $1 USD Currently, Ethereum uses “Proof of Work”. Ethereum is currently working on “Layer 1” and “Layer 2” solutions to improve scalability. “Layer 1” refers to improving the core Ethereum protocol through ETH 2.0. Focus is on decentralization, resilience, security, simplicity, longevity. In ETH 2.0, Ethereum will also be moving to “Proof of Stake”. This phase also Includes Sharding. “Layer 2” refers to technologies that are built “on top” of the base Ethereum protocol, enabling greater scalability without compromising on security. This include projects like State Channels, Side Chains, and Plasma. Ethereum Possible Risks: Ethereum has been a forerunner until it faced its scalability issues. A progressive roadmap has been created to implement technologies which will enable Ethereum to scale up. However, implementation has been slow and there is a scope of competitors taking advantage of the situation. Reference: Coingecko, Ethereum Org Cosmos https://i.redd.it/57tw2r3r21g31.png Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm like Tendermint consensus. Cosmos is designed to let people build custom, secure, scalable and interoperable blockchain applications quickly. Cosmos’ end goal is to create an Internet of Blockchains, a network of blockchains able to communicate with each other in a decentralized way. Cosmos considers itself as a Generation 3.0 Blockchain solving important problems of Generation 2.0 Blockchain (notably Ethereum) Scalability – Cosmos uses Tendermint BFT, which is a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus engine that powers Cosmos Proof-of-Stake. Usability – Cosmos SDK is a modular framework for building interoperable, application-specific blockchains. Interoperability – Cosmos’ Interblockchain Communication (IBC) is a TCP/IP-like messaging protocol for blockchains. Cosmos is an open-source community project initially built by Tendermint Inc. The development of the Cosmos project is led primarily by Tendermint Inc., a for-profit entity. Funding for development comes primarily from the Interchain Foundation, a Swiss non-profit entity. Cosmos has gained huge popularity in 2019 with some major projects building on its protocol. These projects include: Binance Chain – Decentralised Exchange Loom – The very popular project includes a network of DPoS sidechains for highly-scalable games and user-facing DApps. Sentinel – A true p2p and decentralized Applications Resources marketplace. IRISnet – Designed to be the foundation for next-generation distributed business applications. Cosmos Mainnet was launched in March 2019. Cosmos staking generates around 12% yield. Staking can be done through Lunie wallet. Cosmos runs occasional ‘HackAtom’, the latest being organized in Berlin and Seoul. Cosmos Possible Risks: Cosmos is one of the first projects to bring in interoperability solutions however it faces huge competition from Quant, Aion, Ark, ICON, Wanchain, Cardano, Fusion, Polkadot, Oneledger, Block Collider, etc. Cosmos has often been accused of being less transparent in use of proceeds but as long as it delivers, we should be fine.

HPB has a 2-year headstart compared to other firms if they want to take this approach, and this does justify their ICO considering that they manufactured all those chipsets and distributed it for free to their community. The HPB MainNet went live in late September 2018 and is currently ran by 118 nodes (not all invitation node spots are full yet). Thanks to the BOE hardware, the network is capable of achieving more than 5,000 TPS globally and 10,000 TPS within China, where most nodes are currently located. This makes HPB faster and much more decentralized and secure than many competitors that are run by only a fraction of the nodes that HPB and waste much more energy. Their blockchain is running steadily, each one having a unique hardware chipset and download speeds are reaching the hundreds of megabytes. HPB is similar to Tomochain in a lot of ways being an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) but does stand out in a few sectors and the differentiation makes it a very interesting project, also their partnership with Union Pay is one of the better partnerships to come out of China for Blockchain companies. HPB is a permissionless blockchain architecture that combines a customized hardware Blockchain Offload Engine (BOE), with high-performance blockchain software. The addition of BOE, allows for high transaction speed and extremely low latency, without compromise on security and decentralization. HPB supports a smart contract system to facilitate the smooth integration of the existing developer ecosystem. HPB was formed by CEO Wang Xiaoming in 2017 with a core team comprising talents from high-powered multinationals such as Huawei, IBM, Inspur, Alibaba, UnionPay, ICBC, McKinsey and Deloitte, HPB has a team of over 50 staff. HPB has landed a milestone partnership with Shanghai Youwan () to connect its mobile games and the HPB Wallet to expand the connected ecosystems of both parties. This new partnership will bring many new games to the HPB platform, and integrate HPB into their network of apps and companies in which HPB coins and the blockchain itself will be used. Shanghai Youwan is a legal entity belonging to Ping An Entertainment, which belongs to Ping An Insurance. Ping An Insurance is the world’s largest and most valuable insurer, worth US$217 billion, as of January 2018. It is also one of the world’s biggest investment and asset management companies, with a total AUM of US$958.5 billion (6.5 trillion yuan), as of 2017. Some of HPB’s differentiators include \\- Full Customizability – Developers and users can deploy smart contracts onto HPB using any of the mainstream programming languages. \\- Low Maintenance Costs – The BOE hardware chipset is specially developed for low energy consumption. \\- Data System Security – The duo solution of hardware-software enables greater data and system security compared to other blockchain systems. Some important projects building on HPB include \\- UnionPay Smart – A one-stop service platform based on consumer data which provides UnionPay and its partners with various big-data application solutions in industry analysis, business decision-making, investment advisory etc. \\- OKEX, Kucoin – These are Top exchanges on HPB \\- HPB is currently focusing on BOE Hardware and Software optimizations and Expansion of BaaS offerings. HPB Possible Issues: Merging software and hardware is a unique but difficult proposition. HPB will face logistical challenges. It needs to be seen how smoothly HPB implements its solution.

It is an innovative solution to the Ethereum blockchain’s scalability problem, it’s Founder is Long Vuong who was also the co-founder of NEM blockchain. TomoChain has a 150-masternode architecture with its unique Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) giving TomoChain almost zero fees, instant transaction confirmations, and security. Tomochain’s network can handle 1,000 TPS and is implementing more scaling solutions, that will increase to over 20,000 tps. TomoChain supports all Ethereum smart contracts, ethereum community’s developer tools are also compatible with TomoChain and any decentralized application running on Ethereum can run on TomoChain as well making it easy for developers to easily switch between Ethereum and TomoChain. This makes TomoChain a great solution for dApps requiring high throughput and speed. TomoChain is focused on adding dApps to the platform, integrating TomoX (its decentralized exchange), and as you all know we have covered Tomchain on several occasions and is a team favorite. TomoX is in the testing phase and will be the decentralized exchange that Tomochain team is building. But it should integrate into the TomoChain blockchain this year. Finally, with TomoX in development and a host of dApps running on its blockchain, TomoChain plans to ramp up marketing activities toward the end of 2019. Also to encourage dApp development, TomoChain regularly hosts events such as hackathons, workshops, and contests. Since launching its mainnet at the end of 2018, it already has over 17 dApps live on its platform. Tomochain Possible Risks: Ethereum is the main competitor of Tomochain and with the developer might which Ethereum has, Tomochain faces tough competition in a congested space. After the launch of mainnet, it is to be seen how the development of killer dapps proceed on Tomochain blockchain.

Stakeholders govern upgrades to the core protocol, including upgrades to the amendment process itself. The Tezos blockchain project was founded by a US company, Dynamic Ledger Solutions, as an alternative to Ethereum. Important features in Tezos include. Self-Amendment – Self-amendment allows Tezos to upgrade itself without having to split (“fork”) the network into two different blockchains. On-Chain Governance – In Tezos, the election cycle provides a formal and systematic procedure for stakeholders to reach agreement on proposed protocol amendments. Decentralized Innovation – Fosters an active, open, and diverse developer ecosystem that is incentivized to contribute to the protocol. Smart Contracts Formal Verification – Tezos facilitates formal verification, a technique used to improve security by mathematically proving properties about programs such as smart contracts. Delegation – Users who do not wish to participate directly in the consensus protocol have the option to delegate their rights to other users to participate on their behalf. In 2018, Tezos had its own share of controversies when with $232 million in their ICO, the management at Tezos has an internal conflict. Important projects building on Tezos include Tezsure \\-Tezsure is a decentralized insurance marketplace. Powered by AI and the Tezos blockchain. MoneyTrack – Using Tezos for shared, secured, traceable, trusted and automated management of Directed Money programs. VIAZ – First major decentralized peer to peer funding platform on Tezos Clause – Translating legal documents to smart contracts Recently, BTG Pactual, Brazil’s fifth-largest bank, plans to utilize the Tezos blockchain for security token offerings potentially worth $1 billion. Tezos Possible Risks: Tezos has been marred with lots of controversies. Conflicting management has made a very relevant business proposition slow, which has somewhat resulted in losing people’s interest.

Quant promises to enable Enterprise Mass Adoption. Overledger is the world’s first blockchain operating system (OS) that not only connects blockchains to one another but also connects existing networks to blockchain and facilitates the creation of internet-scale multi-chain applications otherwise known as MApps. The applications can communicate, migrate and exchange information and value, regardless of the ledgers on which they’ve been deployed. Overledger enables users to build decentralized multi-chain applications which aren’t single-blockchain dependent. Quant has introduced a concept of treaty contracts. Smart contracts are restricted to single blockchains. Treaty contract enables cross-blockchain communication. For example, Ethereum smart contract listening to events on Ripple! Treaty Contracts and are currently in the testing phase before going live. Headed by CEO, Gilbert Verdian, Quant currently has offices in the UK, Switzerland, Australia, Armenia (Research Lab) and soon to be opening one in New York to meet client demand.

Skycoin (SKY) is a decentralized blockchain-based cryptocurrency that makes significant code improvements compared to Bitcoin. It addresses many emergent problems in Bitcoin and Ethereum that only became apparent after their initial real-world usage. Skycoin has superseded the Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithms, and separated the functions of coin creation, block consensus and block creation. It uses a new consensus algorithm called Obelisk, which is based on Web-of-Trust dynamics and doesn’t require energy-intensive hashing. Separating the function of securing the Skycoin chain from coin creation and block consensus ensures that malicious actors cannot 51% attack Skycoin to reverse transactions or steal coins. Skycoin has faster block time to ensure high transaction throughput, and will support G Maxwell’s CoinJoin privacy functionality at the base layer. The total supply of Skycoins is one hundred million, released over 25 years in a tapered distribution similar to Bitcoin. Source:"

  "reddit": "So I haven't been trading for about two years now. I remembered that I had a poloniex account that I used to trade some Bitcoin for monero and I wanted to see how much Monero I had purchased as I got a new computer and haven't reinstalled my monero wallet (I have the seed for it). Anyway, when I logged back into poloniex, I went through the normal log in process and had a code emailed to me. Then, after I successfully typed in the code, I was transferred to a page where they request I update my profile information. It asks for normal information like street address but also my social security number. In a banner at the top of the screen, it says I will also need to provide a scanned copy of a government issued photo ID. Is this a normal procedure at poloniex now? If so, is Poloniex capable of safely storing this sensitive information?"

  "reddit": "Two of the coolest things happening on Ethereum that most people don't realise are Gas Station Network - allowing dApp creators to pay Gas so users don't even realise Ethereum is running in the background. And Ethereum Doman Service with human readable names replacing alphanumeric addresses. Be sure to check them both out if you haven't already!"

  "reddit": "Obviously I’m going to invest in bitcoin. Ethereum too. I was researching Ripple and it seems like they have a lot going on in terms of institutional partnerships. I want to buy some xrp based on my research, but is that a bad idea? On reddit, people generally don’t seem to like xrp. Why is this?"
